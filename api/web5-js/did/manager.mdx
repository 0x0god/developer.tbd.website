### get(id)

Gets the DID assigned to a given record id

#### Parameters

`id` - The record id of the document to fetch

#### Return Value

The stored DID associated with that record id

#### Code Example
```js
const id = "someRecord";
let data = web5.did.manager.get(id);
```

<Divider type="slash"/>

### delete(id)

Deletes the DID assigned to a given record id

#### Parameters

`id` - The record id of the document to delete

#### Return Value
None

#### Code Example
```js
const id = "someRecord";
web5.did.manager.delete(id);
```

<Divider type="slash"/>

### set(id, value)

The package provides a DID manager mechanism that handles interactions with a DID that is being managed by the local code (be it in a web page, agent app, or elsewhere). By adding a DID to the manager, the library ensures that all interactions with that DID, including things like signing and encryption, are handled automatically.

#### Parameters

`id` - The record id of the document to set

`value` - The value of the data to store

#### Return Value

None

#### Code Example

```js
const id = "someRecord";
const data = {
    key: "value"
}
web5.did.manager.set(id, data);
```
