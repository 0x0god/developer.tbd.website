Simply put, users don\u2019t own their data - services do - and their identity is fragmented across a host of handles, cards, and more. Ideally, we\u2019d have a single form of identification with strong authentication and deep ties to data ownership, rather than scattered identities, lost passwords, and data owned by someone else.

He can still authenticate to all of those services and own all of that data through his primary DID since it\u2019s the controller, but can also easily filter through his data since he\u2019s filed his work things under a separate DID. On the personal side of things, Bob can sign up for new services every day without worrying about migration because he owns all of his data: the second he signs up for a new service, like a social network, he can grant that app access to the media stored on his DWN and that service can act as a presentation layer for his data.

Really, the question is, why do you want to shift to a Web5 paradigm? Because identity portability and data ownership are massive yet silent problems we deal with every day.

Through the proliferation and adoption of DIDs, the popularization of DID controller paradigms and DWNs, and the availability of mass-appeal wallets to enable secure usage of DIDs. The general public wouldn\u2019t ever be expected to have a technical understanding of these concepts, but their proliferation will depend on new and existing apps integrating this tech and presenting it to consumers in an easily-digestable way.
