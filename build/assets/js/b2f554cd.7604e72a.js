Here are a few ways they are being used today.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Employment Verification \\n\\nLinkedIn recently announced a new free [verified badge feature](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23679998/linkedin-verification-badge-system-clear-microsoft-entra) that will be used to prove the validity of your employment, education, and other achievements. \u201cThe system is backed by **decentralized identity and a trust model that involves an issuer, a holder, and a verifier**. Organizations can issue cryptographically signed digital IDs, which employees can then use to prove they work at a company\u2026\u201d \\n\\nLinkedIn is  using the Self-Sovereign Identity trust model connecting an employee\'s DID (subject) with their employer\'s DID (issuer), and LinkedIn as the verifier of the transaction.\\n\\n![SSI Trust Model](/img/ssi-trust-model.png)\\n\\nAs for education verification, LinkedIn users can request that their educational institution issue a [Verifiable Credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) (VC) for their degree or certification. The user can then choose to share the credential with employers or other third parties via LinkedIn, who then verifies the authenticity of the credential using cryptographic proofs.\\n\\n:::info\\nDIDs vs VCs: DIDs provide a way to create and manage decentralized identities, whereas VCs provide a way to prove information about those identities in a secure and portable way.\\n:::\\n\\n## Digital Driver\'s Licenses\\n\\nThe DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in the United States and in Queensland Australia are piloting a program that involves issuing [digital driver\'s licenses](https://www.govtech.com/fs/california-moves-to-test-new-digital-drivers-licenses) and vehicle registration documents that can be accessed and verified using a mobile app. Digital driver\'s license apps are cryptographically secure and can be used to verify the authenticity of the license without the need for physical documents. These apps are backed with the use of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and DIDs. This program will lead to faster and more efficient services for customers, as well as improved security and fraud prevention.\\n\\n## COVID Digital Health Apps\\n\\nIBM used VCs as a key component in its [Digital Health Pass](https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/resources/digital-health-pass-blockchain-explained/) solution to enable individuals to securely and privately present their COVID vaccination status to third parties - such as concert venues and stadium events.\\n\\nWhen an individual needs to prove if they are vaccinated, they can simply present their VC to a verifier (e.g., baseball stadium), who then verifies the authenticity of the credential and the accuracy of the information it contains using cryptographic proofs. \\n\\nThere are several benefits to DIDs and VCs in this use case including privacy protection, security, and efficiency. This simple interaction now allows individuals to maintain control over their personal health information. For example, all they need to disclose is true/false (vaccinated or not) versus a more detailed health record. \\n\\nOverall, the use of VCs and DIDs in the IBM Digital Health Pass provides a secure and privacy-preserving way for individuals to prove their health status, which was essential for enabling safe travel and activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\n## Social Media\\n\\nEven social media applications are embracing the use of decentralized identifiers. Bluesky is a new social platform that serves as a reference implementation of the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/guides/overview), a federated protocol for large-scale social applications. Instead of usernames that are specific to and owned by the application, BlueSky instead uses domain names for identity (e.g. alice.bsky.social). Unbeknownst to most users, these domain names are associated with a DID for the user.\\n\\n![Bluesky DIDs](/img/bluesky-dids.png)\\n\\nThese persistent DIDs enable users to migrate their account data to any other applications that utilize the AT Protocol - therefore giving users more control and ownership over their content.\\n\\n## Future of Decentralized Identity\\n\\nThese companies are embracing the use of decentralized technology for identity management and verification at a massive scale. As this technology continues to mature, we can expect to see more widespread adoption of DIDs in various industries.\\n\\nWant to learn more about DIDs and VCs?

To get a better sense of the why behind decentralized identifiers, we\u2019ll discuss the real problems society faces today when it comes to identity, and why DIDs are an enormous practical solution to a pervasive set of problems.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Identity\\nWhether or not you consider yourself an \u201conline\u201d person, there are a million ways we currently identify ourselves. Do you have an email address? That\u2019s an identity. A driver\u2019s license? Another one there. A Twitter handle? An Instagram account? A phone number? Check, check, check. There are a seemingly incalculable number of ways we can be identified and reached in today\u2019s day and age.\\n\\nToday, however, our identities are deeply entangled with services and the companies that own them. Your Twitter handle, for example, is exclusive to Twitter - good luck trying to get the same username on Instagram. Want to view your text messages alongside your Facebook messages with a person? Not happening. Lastly, good luck trying to recover your data if your service of choice suddenly were to shut down. To put it even more simply, Bob may be able to say \u201chi my name is Bob\u201d on one social network A, but the name \u201cBob\u201d may be reserved on social network B, preventing him from claiming the same name or handle over there. Moreover, if Bob has been a long time user of music app A and decides one day to migrate to music app B, he\u2019ll need to go through the painful process of migrating all his playlists and songs over to the new service.\\n\\n## The Data Problem and Solution\\n![](/img/evolving-the-web.png)\\nSo what\u2019s the fundamental issue DIDs are trying to solve? Simply put, users don\u2019t own their data - services do - and their identity is fragmented across a host of handles, cards, and more. Ideally, we\u2019d have a single form of identification with strong authentication and deep ties to data ownership, rather than scattered identities, lost passwords, and data owned by someone else. All of these concerns are valid and, it\u2019s important to note, not simply hype around a shiny new toy.\\n\\nDIDs solve these problems by coming alongside something called a [Decentralized Web Node (DWN)](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes). Think of DIDs as the identifiers that will allow you to have a truly universal single sign-on experience, while DWNs are a form of data storage that will permit you to own your data while simultaneously being able to use and enjoy all the same kinds of services you currently do.\\n\\nDIDs are, as the name suggests, decentralized - so they\u2019re inherently not controlled, operated, or regulated by a centralized authority like our current identifiers are. You can have as many DIDs as you\u2019d like, but you can also have a main DID act as a controller for your other DIDs to help consolidate or partition data when needed, as well as enforce limitations when appropriate. The implications of both decentralization and a controller paradigm are enormous for a vast number of use cases.\\n\\n## Life, Decentralized\\nConsider this: Bob has a single DID that acts as his main identifier, but he wants to detangle his work and personal identities to avoid having everything come into the same inbox on weekends. He creates two new DIDs that are controlled by his main identity, and labels them as \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cwork.\u201d All of his work emails, calls, texts, and notifications are connected to his work DID, and he can easily silence that noise come Friday night. He can still authenticate to all of those services and own all of that data through his primary DID since it\u2019s the controller, but can also easily filter through his data since he\u2019s filed his work things under a separate DID. On the personal side of things, Bob can sign up for new services every day without worrying about migration because he owns all of his data: the second he signs up for a new service, like a social network, he can grant that app access to the media stored on his DWN and that service can act as a presentation layer for his data. Even better, his employer can also act as a controller on his work DID, allowing them to enforce enterprise requirements while keeping completely siloed from his personal data.\\n\\nIn this paradigm, Bob doesn\u2019t worry about remembering a million passwords or losing his data to a service. The new \u201cpassword\u201d for Bob\u2019s life is access to his main DID, which is protected by his private keys that can be stored in a number of secure ways, including on a physical drive or in a secure digital wallet. Just as significantly, Bob can keep his personal and work lives separate while allowing there to be appropriate separations of authority over his different data silos.\\n\\n## Identity Reinvented\\nSo why do you want a DID? Really, the question is, why do you want to shift to a Web5 paradigm? Because identity portability and data ownership are massive yet silent problems we deal with every day. And how will this shift happen? Through the proliferation and adoption of DIDs, the popularization of DID controller paradigms and DWNs, and the availability of mass-appeal wallets to enable secure usage of DIDs. The general public wouldn\u2019t ever be expected to have a technical understanding of these concepts, but their proliferation will depend on new and existing apps integrating this tech and presenting it to consumers in an easily-digestable way. We don\u2019t just have to limit ourselves to imagining using this design to separate personal and work life - we can use it to allow for advanced parental controls, role access, and more.\\n\\nIf a Web5 future that returns ownership to users and decouples platforms from data sounds appealing to you, be sure to check out our ongoing projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/TBD54566975) or join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tbd)."},{"id":"benri-hosts-ssi-service","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/benri-hosts-ssi-service","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-18-benri-hosts-ssi-service.md","title":"TBD\'s SSI Service hosted by benri.io","description":"benri hosts TBD\'s SSI-Service to enable users to learn more about SSI technology","date":"2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 18, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Self Sovereign Identity","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-sovereign-identity"},{"label":"Web5","permalink":"/blog/tags/web-5"}],"readingTime":2.225,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Andor Kesselman (benri)"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"benri-hosts-ssi-service","title":"TBD\'s SSI Service hosted by benri.io","description":"benri hosts TBD\'s SSI-Service to enable users to learn more about SSI technology","authors":{"name":"Andor Kesselman (benri)"},"tags":["Self Sovereign Identity","Web5"]},"prevItem":{"title":"The Practicality of Decentralized Identifiers","permalink":"/blog/practicality-of-decentralized-identifiers"},"nextItem":{"title":"What Happens To My Content If TikTok Gets Banned?","permalink":"/blog/tiktok-ban-impact-on-creators"}},"content":"<head> \\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/blog/benri-hosts-ssi-service/\\"/>\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"website\\"/>\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"SSI-Service hosted by benri\\"/>\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"SSI-Service hosted by benri\\"/>\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/assets/images/blog-benri-ssi-host3-22507e91e39ff2133a86d16d3e9bdd26.png\\"/>\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary\\" /> \\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:site\\" content=\\"@tbddev\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"twitter:domain\\" content=\\"developer.tbd.website\\"/>\\n  <meta property=\\"twitter:url\\" content=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/blog/benri-hosts-ssi-service/\\"/>\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"SSI-Service hosted by benri\\"/>\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"SSI-Service hosted by benri\\"/>\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/assets/images/blog-benri-ssi-host3-22507e91e39ff2133a86d16d3e9bdd26.png\\"/>\\n        \\n  <link rel=\\"apple-touch-icon\\" href=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/img/tbd-fav-icon-main.png\\" /> \\n\\n</head>\\n\\n![benri Host](/img/blog-benri-ssi-host3.png)\\n\\n[Benri](https://benri.io) is hosting [TBD\'s SSI Service](https://ssi.benri.io) to enable users to learn more about SSI technology.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSelf-sovereign identity (SSI) is a decentralized approach to identity management\\nthat gives individuals control over their personal data.

Consumers are quickly wondering where they\u2019ll go for their short form video content if TikTok is taken away. Creators are faced with the reality that their income could immediately dry up if the most viral social media platform to date disappears. Lastly, businesses could potentially watch one of their most powerful distribution channels go up in flames overnight.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nDistribution and content, two of the most valuable assets on TikTok, are currently owned by the platform instead of the users who worked so hard for them. A follower on TikTok can\u2019t be transferred outside of the platform, and a video on the social media giant is currently owned and stored on TikTok\u2019s servers. It\u2019s the very nature of Web2 infrastructure that platforms like TikTok absorb an incredible amount of ownership and responsibility to store, manage, and steward the relationships and data on them, putting end users and businesses at risk.\\n\\n\\nSo what\u2019s the alternative? How can we build platforms that turn over data ownership to the users of that platform rather than hoard massive amounts of power? The answer is to build Web5 applications that enable users to maintain ownership of their data so platforms can stick to what they do best: curating and serving that data.\\n\\nLet\u2019s consider the model a platform like TikTok currently uses. They ask users to upload videos to TikTok servers and then store, sort, organize, and serve that content. In a Web5 world, users could store their own videos on their own decentralized web node(s) and grant access to that content to TikTok. TikTok would adhere to a common schema to access that content - one that any other platform, such as Facebook or Instagram could access as well, and then layer its own metadata such as likes, comments, and analytics on top of that.\\n\\nFollower counts wouldn\u2019t need to be limited to a single platform, instead allowing users with a single decentralized identifier to follow users, creators, or businesses across platforms. This would decouple platforms and distribution, meaning that the marketing power of individuals and businesses wouldn\u2019t be wholly subject to the whim of community guidelines or editorial discretion of platform owners. In this model, a TikTok ban would simply mean that TikTok\u2019s metadata - like counts, comments, and other analytics - would be stripped away, but the content and creator-follower relationships would persist. TikTok and platforms like it would still be able to curate their excellent algorithms, monetize on in-feed ads, and more, while holding less power over their users\u2019 content and reducing the overhead of storing incredibly large amounts of video content on behalf of their users.\\n\\nIf a Web5 future that returns ownership to users and decouples platforms from data sounds appealing to you, be sure to check out our ongoing projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/TBD54566975) or join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tbd)."},{"id":"chatgpt-writingcode","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/chatgpt-writingcode","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-10-ssi-chat-gpt.md","title":"Web Assembly with ChatGPT","description":"Using ChatGPT to help add WASM support to the self-sovereign identity SDK","date":"2023-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 10, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Self Sovereign Identity","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-sovereign-identity"},{"label":"SSI","permalink":"/blog/tags/ssi"},{"label":"AI","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"label":"ChatGPT","permalink":"/blog/tags/chat-gpt"}],"readingTime":3.32,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Mic Neale"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"chatgpt-writingcode","title":"Web Assembly with ChatGPT","description":"Using ChatGPT to help add WASM support to the self-sovereign identity SDK","authors":{"name":"Mic Neale"},"tags":["Self Sovereign Identity","SSI","AI","ChatGPT"]},"prevItem":{"title":"What Happens To My Content If TikTok Gets Banned?","permalink":"/blog/tiktok-ban-impact-on-creators"},"nextItem":{"title":"Manually Issue a Verifiable Credential","permalink":"/blog/issue-verifiable-credential-manually"}},"content":"<head>\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Web Assembly with ChatGPT\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\'https://developer.tbd.website/blog/chatgpt-writingcode\' />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"/img/wasm-chatgpt-ssi.png\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"Using ChatGPT to help add WASM support to the self-sovereign identity SDK\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"/img/wasm-chatgpt-ssi.png\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:site\\" content=\\"@tbddev\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"Web Assembly with ChatGPT\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"Using ChatGPT to help add WASM support to the self-sovereign identity SDK\\" />\\n  <link rel=\\"apple-touch-icon\\" href=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/img/tbd-fav-icon-main.png\\" />\\n</head>\\n\\n\\n## Web Assembly\\n\\n[Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/) is a popular format for running binary applications in web browsers (with wide support).\\n\\nThis can have a few advantages but the interesting thing for us is that this can allow sharing of implementations of functionality: credential issuance, DID resolving, cryptographic functions, etc which you may not want to necessarily re-implement in JavaScript or TypeScript.\\n\\nThe [SSI-SDK](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk) is an implementation of a lot of standards for self sovereign identity, so it is a great candidate to expose via WASM to web apps. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nNow there is a whole lot of (lets face it: tedious) machinery to get WASM to be compiled from Go (ok if you are really curious you can [read the code](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/pull/265/)), but the upshot of it is that there is a .wasm file produced which when consumed in just the right way in a web page, allows you to call functions from JavaScript, that look and feel like JavaScript, but are actually running in the web-assembly machiner (and compiled down from Golang).\\n\\nSay you had a function in Golang land which looked like this: \\n\\n```go\\n// Resolve attempts to resolve a DID for a given method\\nfunc (dr Resolver) Resolve(did string, opts ...ResolutionOptions) (*DIDResolutionResult, error) {\\n  ...\\n```\\n\\nYou could call it from the web via:\\n```javascript\\nconsole.log(resolveDid(\\"did:peer:0z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH\\"));\\n```\\n\\nand it would Just Work thanks to WASM! \\nWell, thanks to WASM and a lot of boring glue. \\n\\n\\n## ChatGPT\\n\\nBut the boring glue is what I am here to talk about it, as it turns out ChatGPT can be quite helpful for the boring (but important) glue. \\n\\nSo firstly, there is some work to be done to build a shim between the JavaScript type world and the Golang type world: \\n\\n```go\\n// 1. Simplest function - note we wrap things with js.ValueOf (if a primitive you don\'t technically need to)\\nfunc sayHello(_ js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {\\n\\treturn js.ValueOf(\\"Hello from golang via wasm!\\")\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis gets more complicated when you have more complicated types, but essentially this is the pattern you follow to expose functionality. Now I am a pretty ordinary Golang developer, so being lazy I thought I would see if I could teach ChatGPT about WASM and if it could write this glue code for me. \\n\\nHelpfully the SSI-SDK has a good amount of test coverage, so to teach ChatCPT about the API I was trying to expose, I pasted in a test case which exercised the API. The functionality was the \\"Resolve\\" function above, and the test code showed how to use it. \\n\\nI then asked ChatGPT to provide a WASM friendly wrapper for that functionality:\\n\\n\\n![chatgpt generated resolver](/img/chatgpt_resolver.png)\\n\\nTo do this, I gave it an example of some previously written code that uses some (unrelated) functionality and also exposes it to WASM. As you can see it was happy to provide an implementation which whilst close, with some minor tweaking. \\n\\nI was able to tidy it up and include it in the [pull request](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/pull/265). Handy - thanks ChatGPT!\\nMoreover, as I am an ordinary Golang developer I was able to ask it to put in a retry on error (also some important glue) when using WASM from a web app (this staved a minor amount of googling): \\n\\n\\n![chatgpt generated error handler](/img/chatgpt_error.png)\\n\\n\\n## Parting thoughts\\n\\nWASM seems surpremely useful, and ChatGPT, while terrifying on one level, looks like it can really take away some of the grind work from developers, allowing us to move much faster into more platforms. And no, this post was NOT written by ChatGPT, but by a human."},{"id":"issue-verifiable-credential-manually","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/issue-verifiable-credential-manually","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-04-manually-issue-vcs.md","title":"Manually Issue a Verifiable Credential","description":"Learn how to issue a verifiable credential","date":"2023-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 4, 2023","tags":[{"label":"verifiable credentials","permalink":"/blog/tags/verifiable-credentials"}],"readingTime":5.475,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Bobbilee Hartman"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"issue-verifiable-credential-manually","title":"Manually Issue a Verifiable Credential","description":"Learn how to issue a verifiable credential","authors":{"name":"Bobbilee Hartman"},"tags":["verifiable credentials"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Web Assembly with ChatGPT","permalink":"/blog/chatgpt-writingcode"},"nextItem":{"title":"Currency of Freedom","permalink":"/blog/currency-of-freedom"}},"content":"<head>\\n  <title>Manually Issue a Verifiable Credential</title>\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"Learn how to issue a verifiable credential\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Manually Issue a Verifiable Credential\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\'https://developer.tbd.website/blog/issue-verifiable-credential-manually\' />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/img/tutorial_issue_vc.png\\" />\\n  \\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/img/tutorial_issue_vc.png\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:site\\" content=\\"@tbddev\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"Manually Issue a Verifiable Credential\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"Learn how to issue a verifiable credential\\" />\\n  <link rel=\\"apple-touch-icon\\" href=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/img/tbd-fav-icon-main.png\\" />\\n</head>\\n\\n## \\n\\n![Manually Issue a Verifiable Credential](/img/tutorial_issue_vc.png)\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  This is a walk through of the VC issuance process from the\\n  perspective of the issuer.

There have been a flurry of conventions, discussions, papers, standards, software, and industry wide adoption of technology based on the principles of SSI. The space is at its most mature, and only growing.\\n\\n[Block](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-changes-name-to-block)\u2019s mission is economic empowerment. Historically, this has looked like building products and offering services such as [Square](https://squareup.com/), enabling millions of merchants _to take payments, manage staff, and conduct business in-store and online_, and [CashApp](https://cash.app/), which enables millions, especially the un and under-banked to send, spend, bank, and invest their money (and Bitcoin!). When [TBD](https://www.tbd.website/), a new business unit at [Block](https://block.xyz/) formed in 2021, we expanded on Block\u2019s mission, setting out to help create _a decentralized future that returns ownership and control over your finances, data, and identity_. TBD\u2019s mission is strongly aligned with the principles of SSI.\\n\\nTo facilitate our mission, TBD launched [Web5](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5): a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols. Web5 takes SSI concepts, standards, and software and provides them as an opinionated bundle to enable all that self sovereignty and digital identity has to offer. What TBD is building for Web5 has a number of components today, and more tomorrow. Among those are the Self Sovereign Identity SDK and Self Sovereign Identity Service (SSI SDK, and SSI Service), Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN), and Identity Wallets. At the time of writing, all of these components are under active development. This was an intentional move by the team to adopt an \u2018open-by-default\u2019 model, and include the community in the development of Web5 from the beginning.\\n\\nHere we\u2019ll lay out the vision for a key component of Web5: Self Sovereign Identity. Specifically, how we at TBD are building standards based software in a community towards the goals of SSI and Web5. The two \u201cSSI\u201d named projects \u2014 the SSI Service and SSI SDK \u2014 sit along side Decentralized Web Nodes, Identity Wallets, User Interfaces, and much more \u2014 but focus on a set of standards-based building blocks of the Web5 stack.\\n\\n## Software Mission\\n\\n**TBD is developing open source, standards-based software to facilitate Self Sovereign Identity on Web5.**\\n\\n### Open Standards\\n\\nThe vision of SSI is realized via [Open Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard#:~:text=%22Open%20Standards%22%20are%20standards%20made,are%20intended%20for%20widespread%20adoption.). Crucially, these standards are accessible to all: to view and to contribute. You may not be aware of it, but you interact with Open Standards every day: whether via web browsers, hardware you use and their underlying protocols, programming languages, audio files, internet and bluetooth devices, text documents, chat applications, encryption you use and so much more. Open Standards facilitate nearly every aspect of modern computation.\\n\\nIn the SSI space there a number of standards bodies that facilitate SSI-standard development. Though we may utilize specifications in multiple organizations such as the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/), [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/foundation/), the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/), and [Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)](https://identity.foundation/). TBD\u2019s focus thus far has been primarily with the W3C and [DIF](http://identity.foundation/) organizations:\\n\\n### The W3C\\n\\nThe W3C, founded by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) in 1994, is one of the most prominent international standards organizations for the web. The W3C has a number of group types. Community Groups are the most open. The [Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/) focused on Verifiable Credentials, and often serves as a staging ground for the [Verifiable Credentials Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc), responsible for the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model) (i.e. the Verifiable Credentials specification). The [Decentralized Identifier Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/did) is responsible for [Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (i.e. the DID specification).\\n\\nTBD is a member of the W3C, actively utilizes the work items from all three groups, and has made contributions to each group\u2019s corpus.\\n\\n### The Decentralized Identity Foundation\\n\\nThe Decentralized Identity Foundation, or DIF, was founded in 2017 to focus on Decentralized Identity. Since then, it\u2019s expanded to house a number of working groups around Identifiers, Claims & Credentials, Sidetree, Secure Data Storage, Wallet Security, Interoperability, and more. DIF produces technical specifications, reference implementations (as in the case of Sidetree and [ION](https://identity.foundation/ion)), and coordinates standards and software implementations for players across the industry.\\n\\nTBD is a member of DIF, regularly attends working groups, contributing to both interoperability projects, specifications, and technical implementations.\\n\\n### Standards in Use\\n\\nThe set of standards we rely on and use for Web5 is unbound. However, we have a good sense of the standards we begin with. The list below will likely soon be out of date.

There are at least another half dozen either included or planned to be included in our software.\\n\\n## TBD Community\\n\\nTBD is interested in building a space for community-driven projects, community members gaining merge and moderation access to community resources, and growing a diverse set of contributors interested in a broad set of use cases to be built on Web5. \\n\\nWe are not interested in becoming a standards body itself. Instead, we are focused on fostering a self-sustaining community focused on building and building on Web5. To facilitate this, we can expand our existing tools like adding sections of our [Forums](https://forums.tbd.website/), creating new [Discord](https://discord.gg/tbd) channels, creating new purpose-specific [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/TBD54566975) and investing in new tools for collaboration like an ideas board, job listing page, or a Web5 wiki. I\u2019d love to see a Web5 incubator similar to [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) that facilitates those building on Web5. The future\u2019s possibilities are endless, and we are eager to adapt to the evolving needs of the community.\\n\\nSometimes, we may need more rigorous structure. As such, we are interested in forming working groups in the Web5 community where it makes sense. The output of these groups could be industry coordination, use-case building, software development, or even standards-related work that can be contributed to existing standards bodies. TBD has kicked off one such group to date around Credentials, first focused on creating a path for Know Your Customer (KYC) Credentials. This group already follows such a pattern: having built out [use-case documentation in GitHub](https://github.com/TBD54566975/credentials-working-group), having a purpose-specific [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/937858703112155166/969682739005624412), and [forum category](https://forums.tbd.website/c/self-sovereign-identity-users/credentials-working-group/6). Soon we\u2019ll adapt this group to a more \u201coffice hours\u201d-style format, allowing anyone in the community to show off their work, ask for assistance, and help shape our project development roadmaps. \\n\\nToday we have one [GitHub org](https://github.com/TBD54566975), run by the TBD team. We will open up roles for community management. Creating light processes for community-driven moderation and maintenance (e.g. managing pull requests, issues, labels, and milestones), in addition to having projects and repositories started and managed entirely by members of the community. One such idea we are considering is for a new GitHub organization for the \u201cWeb5 Community\u201d to foster and highlight community-driven efforts. We\u2019re additionally looking to launch an Incubation program that gives a formal path towards recognizing and promoting the work that begins in a grassroots manner in our community. We plan on making the rest of our tooling community-driven as well: today this means Discord and the Forums, tomorrow it will be a lot more!\\n\\nWhile this is something we are focused on internally, it is crucial that you as community members are able to make suggestions, plans, and directly influence change. Reach out on Discord, our Forums, gain mindshare for your ideas, and we will help make them a reality.\\n\\n## Open Source\\n\\nThe foundations of Web5 are [open source](https://github.com/TBD54566975). This means that its source code is publicly available and, as stewards, we rely on external contribution\u2014Web5 is only successful with the full innovation of a global community. Certainly there are cases where code cannot be open source for various reasons: this applies to the TBD business as well as members of our community. We do not mandate open source, but it is a guiding principle. We believe in the power of open, and all that comes with it. The more open Web5 can be, the better it will be.\\n\\nProjects in the TBD GitHub may originate at TBD, or through the community (on our Discord, Forums). Today, the TBD team is acting as the primary steward and maintainer of all projects. As the community matures, we expect it to take the lead and for TBD to assume a higher-level maintainer role. We imagine this ends up looking like more community-driven projects, community members gaining merge and moderation access, and growing a diverse set of contributors interested in a broad set of use cases to be built on Web5. More broadly, we want to push forward to a world where TBD does not have the only, or final say on any Web5 decision: **decentralization is a strength in the development of Web5**.\\n\\nThis transition is only made possible by active engagement from the community. It is the reason our code is open, and we have set up avenues for engagement. We look towards the community to engage with TBD and others, and push for the future we wish to see built.\\n\\n## Software Vision\\n\\n**TBD is fostering a set of community-driven, open source, standards-based software to facilitate Self Sovereign Identity on Web5.**\\n\\nWe want to realize the vision of the Web5 community: *to build pragmatic standards-based software that serves a wide variety of needs*. The software shall not be tied to any specific entity, nor, without good reason, exclude possibilities within the SSI space. Balancing both feature-richness and complexity we must work closely with our users to design software that meets the needs of all who wish to be on Web5. We think in terms of toolkits, composed of the purpose-specific tools in them. These toolkits exist in a hierarchy of abstractions from which powerful, intuitive, and human-centric software can be built.\\n\\nThe software must be designed in a flexible, modular manner. This means interfaces that feature a default implementation or two, but can be extended to facilitate integration into many systems (e.g. swapping out databases, encryption methods, credential formats as needed). The software is intended to be built on open standards in the SSI space. The standards space is fast-changing and there may be cases where we use ill-defined and ill-supported standards; we must be able to favor practicality and working implementations over robust standards with a commitment to see the standards through. There may be cases where we use our software to innovate past the current state of these standards and open the opportunity to contribute back to existing standards and standards bodies.\\n\\nWe recognize that the SSI ecosystem is full of competing and developing standards. Often this can feel like developing against a set of moving targets and promises of feature sets. There\u2019s a lot of information to grok and everyone has an opinion\u2014this is a good thing! It can be difficult to pick winners, and even more difficult to choose between multiple standards that appear to do the same thing: we do not want to create a Swiss Army knife that contains five different types of scissors, we\u2019d rather it contain one (or maybe two) scissors that get the job done well 99% of the time. We favor evaluating the addition of features and standards on a case-by-case basis, and looking towards implementations of standards and features that are well-reasoned, with committed developers. Bonus points if there is already demonstrated usage and interoperability.\\n\\nWe also recognize that the SSI ecosystem uses a wide set of tools, languages, and technologies: working across web browsers, mobile applications, backend servers, ledgers, and more. For languages we\u2019ve started with [Go](https://go.dev/) (for the SSI SDK and SSI Service) because of its robust cryptographic support, speed, ability to be compiled to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/), and, above all else, simplicity. It is crucial that the code we write is approachable to encourage contribution. Simple and clear is always preferred over clever. The future is multi-language, and multi-platform. We welcome initiatives for improving multi-language and multi-platform support, and are open to fostering them into our GitHub organization.\\n\\n## SSI SDK\\n\\nNamed `ssi-sdk`, this SDK encapsulates a set of standards related to [Self Sovereign Identity](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html). The `ssi-sdk` intends to provide flexible functionality based on a set of standards-based primitives for building decentralized identity applications in a modular manner: with limited dependencies between components.\\n\\nPrimarily, the SDK serves to support Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials and their associated standards. Interacting with Decentralized Identifiers: resolving identifiers, signing, verifying, encrypting, and decrypting data using cryptographic keys found in DID Documents. Interacting with Verifiable Credentials: creating and using data schemas, facilitating credential application, issuance, and exchange.\\n\\nThe SDK is an active work in progress, and can be found on the [TBD GitHub](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk).\\n\\n## SSI Service\\n\\nThe Self Sovereign Identity Service (SSIS) facilitates all things relating to [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model) \u2014 in a box! The service is a part of a larger [Decentralized Web Platform](https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5) architecture. The SSI Service is a JSON-API web service that wraps the [ssi-sdk](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk) to facilitate user-focused interactions on Web5. The service is intended to interact with user interfaces, wallets, decentralized web nodes, and other web infrastructure. \\n\\nBy taking the lower-level building blocks exposed by the SDK, the service is intended to drastically lower the barrier to entry for any individual or organization interesting in building on the Web5 stack. Like the SDK, it is agnostic to any specific business or use case, and design to be pluggable into external infrastructure whether existing or new. \\n\\nThe service is assumed to be run by a single organization and assumes external authentication and authorization. The service assumes no infrastructure requirements and is flexible to multiple deployment models, databases, key management solutions, and user interfaces. We expect that a wide array of users and use cases will use and build on top of the service, creating layers of abstraction and intermediation for processing business logic, handling user accounts, and so on.\\n\\nThe service is an active work in progress, and can be found on the [TBD GitHub](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-service).\\n\\n## How Features are Developed\\n\\nWe are in the early days of Web5. By intention, we\u2019ve announced our ideas and projects way before they are ready for an alpha release, let alone inclusion in a production-ready application. Transparency is an asset in sharing our thinking and gaining mindshare for what we are building. As such, there are many forks in the road fast-approaching. To move past these forks, and the forks after those I introduce some light process to guide principled decision making:\\n\\n1. Features shall be developed using the [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method): making statements, interrogating them, asking *whys* and *hows*, being intellectually honest with risk, uncertainty, consider second, third and n-order effects.\\n2. All new feature proposals shall include a light design document outlining desired functionality, end-user utility, prior art, room for improvement and next steps, risks and mitigations, considerations, and open questions.\\n3. A quorum of project maintainers shall review and progress feature proposals in a timely manner.\\n\\nTemplates for the aforementioned process have been created on each GitHub repository. I encourage you to create GitHub issues and Forum discussions to explore thinking, and revise designs before going forth with a contribution.\\n\\nFor templates on feature development, philosophies on versioning and releases, and more information view our GitHub documentation: \\n\\n[SSI Service GitHub Docs](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-service) | [SSI SDK GitHub Docs](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk)\\n\\n## The Goal\\n\\nI believe in setting public and ambitious *measurable* goals. This serves as a powerful self-discipline mechanism, as well as a call to action for forward progress. Officially the [timeline for Web5 can be found on our site](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/web5-roadmap). Unofficially, here is my ambition:\\n\\n**By January 1st 2023 the following shall be true:**\\n\\n- The first beta release of the SSI SDK and SSI Service (0.1.0) will be released.\\n- Each SSI project will have >75% test coverage.\\n- Each project will have robust user and developer documentation with clear examples.\\n- The SSI SDK will have feature complete specification implementations for at least all fifteen standards identified above.\\n- The SSI Service will be deployable in an infrastructure-agnostic manner, demonstrated on \u2265 2 platforms.\\n- The SSI Service will facilitate practical end-user flows facilitating:\\n    - Creating and managing DIDs using \u2265 2 DID methods\\n    - Creating and issuing Verifiable Credentials backed by JSON schemas\\n    - Creating Credential Manifests, accepting Credential Applications, and fulfilling Credential Applications\\n    - Creating Presentation Definitions, sending Presentation Requests, and accepting Presentation Submissions\\n    - Creating Credential Revocations and checking Credentials against them\\n    - Creating and processing Trust Establishment documents\\n- The SSI SDK and Service will support the Decentralized Web Node specification and the Service will work with at least one DWN.\\n\\n## Parting Thoughts\\n\\nYou should now have a pretty good sense of how we conceive of SSI software on Web5, and how its journey will unfold. Most importantly the mission is not TBD\u2019s alone, it is that of the community. We build real software for real people and favor pragmatism above all else. What I\u2019ve written here is *current thinking* and is always subject to evolution\u2014with your help. I\u2019m looking forward to you joining us in pushing SSI and Web5 forward, gaining new perspectives, solving new use-cases, and building some cool shit."},{"id":"what-are-verifiable-credentials","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-17-what-are-verifiable-credentials.md","title":"What are Verifiable Credentials?","description":"What are Verifiable Credentials, who issues them, and how do they get verified","date":"2022-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 17, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Verifiable Credentials","permalink":"/blog/tags/verifiable-credentials"},{"label":"Decentralized Identity","permalink":"/blog/tags/decentralized-identity"}],"readingTime":5.525,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Jabbar (Community Contributor)"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"what-are-verifiable-credentials","title":"What are Verifiable Credentials?","description":"What are Verifiable Credentials, who issues them, and how do they get verified","authors":{"name":"Saeed Jabbar (Community Contributor)"},"tags":["Verifiable Credentials","Decentralized Identity"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Self Sovereign Identity, TBD, and Web5","permalink":"/blog/ssi-tbd-web5"},"nextItem":{"title":"Our Interoperability Work in the Decentralized Identity Foundation","permalink":"/blog/our-interop-work-in-dif"}},"content":"<head>\\n  <title>What are Verifiable Credentials?</title>\\n  <meta name=\\"description\\" content=\\"What are verifiable credentials, who issues them, and how do they get verified\\" />\\n  \\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:type\\" content=\\"website\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"What are Verifiable Credentials?\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:description\\" content=\\"What are verifiable credentials, who issues them, and how do they get verified\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:image\\" content=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/assets/images/what_are_vcs_banner-1ec4bea6c245b62b76685a338d5f8d63.png\\" />\\n\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary_large_image\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"twitter:domain\\" content=\\"developer.tbd.website\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"twitter:url\\" content=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"What are Verifiable Credentials?\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"What are Verifiable Credentials, who issues them, and how do they get verified\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/assets/images/what_are_vcs_banner-1ec4bea6c245b62b76685a338d5f8d63.png\\" />\\n  <link rel=\\"apple-touch-icon\\" href=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/img/tbd-fav-icon-main.png\\" />\\n</head>\\n\\n## \\n\\n![What Are Verifiable Credentials](/img/what_are_vcs_banner.png)\\n\\nWhen you hear the term \'credential\', what comes to mind? Is it a driver\'s license, passport,  birth certificate, college degree, state ID? The common thread of these forms of credentials is that they are physical items, verified by recognized centralized bodies like a government agency or accredited university.  \\n\\nSo how do credentials translate into the digital world where within a few clicks someone can make a fictitious identity? Introducing... **verifiable credentials** (VCs), a digitally signed electronic credential that follows an [open standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) that lets you create, own, and manage your credentials across a variety of platforms.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Why Do We Need Verifiable Credentials?\\n\\nOver the course of your digital history, you\'ve likely signed up for hundreds of apps and services with elements of your personal data fragmented, such as your name, email address, or more sensitive information like your date of birth and government ID number. These services then share your data with other third parties that you may not even be aware of - with or without your consent. It\'s difficult to go back and deactivate your profiles, delete your accounts, or reclaim additional data these services have collected on you. Worse is if there is a data breach in one of these services and now your data is out in the public.\\n\\nVerifiable Credentials aim to solve these problems by putting the power to manage your data back into your hands. Imagine being able to own and control your personal data by only allowing access to services that require it and having the authority to disable services that no longer need it. You can even manage your data on your own self-hosted decentralized web node via an identity hub without relying on any centralized third party. \\n\\nAdditionally, you can own multiple Verifiable Credentials for various use cases such as a student ID, a driver\'s license, a passport, or a certificate you earned. You can also have one specific Verifiable Credential with multiple [presentation layers](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations) such as a passport where certain metadata is presented when used in a given context.\\n\\n## How Do Verifiable Credentials Work?\\n\\nYou may be wondering who actually issues a Verifiable Credential, how does it get verified and who verifies the verifier? \\n\\nLet\'s look at the following example of the manual way credentials are issued. You\'ve been accepted to your top university of choice and now need a student ID to access both the campus and online resources. Specifically, you want to apply for a campus parking permit as well. \\n\\nTypically this process would involve you taking physical copies of multiple forms of ID verification such as a passport, birth certificate, and driver\'s license to a physical office. Then after a few days of various checks, you\'re finally issued a physical student ID card from that university. The university trusts the entity that issued your birth certificate, passport, and driver\'s license to create a student ID for you. They can even look you up by the identification numbers on these documents. \\n\\nBut what if someone in the admissions office looked up your driver\'s license and noticed those parking tickets you have? Were they even allowed to do so and could this bias their decision to give you a parking permit?\\n\\nThe current process looks something like this:\\n\\n![Issuing a Student ID manually](/img/issue_student_id_manually.png)\\n\\n\\nNow let\u2019s look at how verifiable credentials could help in this scenario. The university would run verification checks for each document provided (passport, driver\u2019s license, birth certificate, etc) and the credential would be limited to just basic bio data that is required such as a legal name, date of birth, etc. So no one from the student department will be able to see your ticketing history associated with your driver\u2019s license.\\n\\n![Issuing a Student ID as a Verifiable Credential](/img/issue_vc_for_student_id.png)\\n\\n\\n## Using Verified Credentials \\n\\nDecentralized identifiers (DIDs) work alongside Verifiable Credentials. DIDs are unique identifiers that let us reference various VCs and the entities that also issue those credentials. For example a government or company can have their own unique DID. \\n\\n**DIDs use the following schema:**\\n\\n![did:example:12345abcde](/img/did-format.png) \\n*photo credit: W3C*\\n\\nDIDs can then be used to create a Verified Credential by digitally signing it and assigning it to a holder, similar to how transactions are cryptographically signed in a blockchain. Depending on the signature format of the credential, the holder (also known as a DID subject) can then choose how much of that credential they want to present to an entity requesting the credential, which is referred to as selective disclosure. \\n\\nAn example is an employer, Company X, who looks up the DID of your college diploma from University Y. \\n\\nCompany X queries the issuer of your Diploma Verifiable Credential, in this case University Y, and also looks up the DID of that university in a verifiable data registry (VDR). Think of VDRs as just lists that can be managed and maintained by various parties such as wallets, financial institutions, DAOs, non-profits, etc. If your credentials have valid digital signatures but somehow University Y is on a list of non-accredited institutions in the USA but accredited institutions in Europe, it would be up to the Company X to decide if they want to accept it.\\n\\nThe diagram below outlines the flow of this process.\\n\\n![issuer issues a verifiable credential to a holder who can send a presentation of their VC to a verifier](/img/vc_ecosystem.svg)\\n*photo credit: W3C*\\n\\n\\n## Use Cases for Verifiable Credentials\\n\\nThere are several use cases that can be realized with the use of Verifiable Credentials, such as\\n\\n- Employment checks without being invasive \\n- Managing of health records, land titles, etc\\n- Managing of various forms of personal identification such as passports, driver\u2019s licenses, etc \\n- KYC (Know Your Customer) checks for financial institutions and businesses\\n- Managing your gamer profile across different metaverses\\n- Managing Memberships\\n\\nDIDs and VCs allow us to create identities and credentials in an interoperable ecosystem that allow developers and businesses to build a new wave of products, applications, and services that put users in control."},{"id":"our-interop-work-in-dif","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/our-interop-work-in-dif","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-15-our-interop-work-in-dif.md","title":"Our Interoperability Work in the Decentralized Identity Foundation","description":"How TBD Contributes with the community to interoperability testing in the Decentralized Identity Foundation","date":"2022-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 15, 2022","tags":[{"label":"DIF","permalink":"/blog/tags/dif"},{"label":"W3C","permalink":"/blog/tags/w-3-c"},{"label":"Community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"label":"Decentralized Identity","permalink":"/blog/tags/decentralized-identity"}],"readingTime":1.995,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"TBDevelopers"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"our-interop-work-in-dif","title":"Our Interoperability Work in the Decentralized Identity Foundation","description":"How TBD Contributes with the community to interoperability testing in the Decentralized Identity Foundation","authors":{"name":"TBDevelopers"},"tags":["DIF","W3C","Community","Decentralized Identity"]},"prevItem":{"title":"What are Verifiable Credentials?","permalink":"/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials"},"nextItem":{"title":"Web5 Roadmap","permalink":"/blog/web5-roadmap"}},"content":"<head>\\n  <meta property=\\"og:title\\" content=\\"Our Interoperability Work in the Decentralized Identity Foundation\\" />\\n  <meta property=\\"og:url\\" content=\'https://developer.tbd.website/blog/2022-08-15-our-interop-work-in-dif\' />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:site\\" content=\\"@tbddev\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"Our Interoperability Work in the Decentralized Identity Foundation\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"How TBD Contributes with the community to interoperability testing in the Decentralized Identity Foundation\\" />\\n  <link rel=\\"apple-touch-icon\\" href=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/img/tbd-fav-icon-main.png\\" />\\n</head>\\n\\n## \\n\\n![Our Interoperability Work in the Decentralized Identity Foundation](/img/tbd_spruce_did_interoperability.png)\\n\\nAt TBD, we believe in a decentralized future that returns ownership and control \\nover your finances, data, and identity.

Interop is what allows standard technologies to play \\nnicely with one another, regardless of the backing vendor implementation.\\n\\nTBD and Spruce now support all \\n[five JWS algorithms](https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020#jose-conformance) \\nfor [JSON Web Signature 2020](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/) \\n(Data Integrity Proofs) using \\n[JSON Web Tokens](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) (JWTs) \\nfor [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) (VCs) \\nand [W3C Verifiable Presentations](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0) \\n(VPs).\\n\\nWe can only realize the full potential of Decentralized Identity if we \\nhave networks of Issuers and Verifiers that can produce and consume one \\nanother\u2019s data. The real power of Decentralized Identity is the controlled \\nsharing of information directly between individuals and other entities, \\nwhich makes interoperability a necessity.\\n\\nMore details about the Conformance Test Suite that was developed by members \\nof DIF and our interoperability test reports can be found here:\\n\\n* [TBD\u2019s test results of JWS Test Suite](https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/#tbd)\\n* [Spruce\u2019s test results of JWS Test Suite](https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/#spruce)\\n\\nAt TBD, we support open standards wherever appropriate, and all of our projects are open source. We know our efforts will only be successful if we work in public with the community. We are grateful to work with folks like Spruce and Transmute in the W3C and DIF. By collaborating on common goals in accordance with our ethos, as this achievement exemplifies, we can accelerate the adoption of Decentralized Identity."},{"id":"web5-roadmap","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/web5-roadmap","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-26-web5-roadmap.md","title":"Web5 Roadmap","description":"We\u2019re committed to an open

href=\\"https://developer.tbd.website/img/tbd-fav-icon-main.png\\" />\\n</head>\\n\\n![What is Web5?](/img/what_is_web5.png)\\n\\nWeb 5 is a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols.\\n\\nIn the current web model, users do not own their data or identity. They are given accounts by companies and their data is held captive in app silos. To create a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center, we must empower them with self-owned identity and restore control over their data.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Components of Web 5\\n\\nThere are three main pillars of the decentralized web platform, all of which are based on open standards.\\n\\n![The pillars of Web5 are Decentralized Identifiers (self-owned identifiers that enable decentralized identity authentication and routing), Verifiable Credentials (data formats and models for cryptographic presentation and verification of claims), and Decentralized Web Nodes (data storage and message relay nodes that serve as the foundation for decentralized apps and protocols).](/img/pillars-of-web5.png)\\n\\n## Decentralized Identifiers\\n\\nThe identifiers we know and use today are owned by the government, a company, an organization, or some other intermediary. For example, our email addresses and social media handles are identifiers associated with us but are owned and controlled by the service providers. These companies have the right to ban, disable, or delete these identifiers and we have little to no control over this.\\n\\nSo before we can realize truly decentralized applications, we need decentralized identifiers that users own and control. This removes the dependency on centralized entities to authenticate and represent us.\\n\\n\u200b\u200b[Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (DIDs) are a W3C standard. They have a standardized structure that essentially links to you and your information.\\n\\n![A DID is comprised of three parts: Scheme, DID Method, and DID Method Specific String](/img/did-example.png)\\n\\nThey are a long string of text that consists of three parts:\\n\\n- the URI scheme identifier, which is did\\n- the identifier for a [DID method](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-methods)\\n- the DID method-specific identifier\\n\\nStoring DIDs on [ION](https://identity.foundation/ion/) (a Layer 2 DID network that runs on top of Bitcoin) is a preferred design decision for the implementation of Web 5. ION is a decentralized replacement for DNS for identity identifiers, so there are no authorities, coordinators, tokens, or other centralized bottleneck.\\n\\n**DIDs are the only component of Web5 that touch a blockchain**, which is generally limited to anchoring the keys/endpoints linked to the ID.\\n\\nThat being said, anchoring DIDs on Bitcoin (or any blockchain) is not a requirement. In fact, what\'s great about having the standardized formatting for DIDs is that they can be anchored anywhere or not anchored at all and this still works, although with varying levels of decentralization.\\n\\nHere are examples of DIDs on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain, and the web. Notice they all use the same format: scheme, DID method, and DID method-specific identifier.\\n\\n```json\\ndid:btcr:xyv2-xzpq-q9wa-p7t\\ndid:ens:some.eth\\ndid:web:example.com\\n```\\n\\nBecause personal data is not stored on the blockchain, the DID essentially acts as a URI that associates the subject of the DID (the person, company, or object being identified) with a DID document that lives off-chain.\\n\\nDID Documents are JSON files stored in decentralized storage systems such as IPFS, and describe how to interact with the DID subject. The DID Document contains things like the DID subject\'s public keys, authentication and verification methods, and service endpoints that reference the locations of the subject\u2019s data.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"@context\\": \\"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1\\",\\n  \\"id\\": \\"did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8\\",\\n  \\"verificationMethod\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"id\\": \\"did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8\\",\\n      \\"type\\": \\"Secp256k1VerificationKey2018\\",\\n      \\"controller\\": \\"did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\"authentication\\": [\\"did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8\\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Verifiable Credentials\\n\\n[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) are a fully ratified W3C standard that work hand in hand with Decentralized Identifiers to enable trustless interactions - meaning two parties do not need to trust one another to engage, but claims made about a DID subject can be verified.\\n\\nFor example, Alice needs to prove she has a bank account at Acme Bank. Acme Bank issues a cryptographically signed Verifiable Credential which would be stored in Alice\'s identity wallet.\\n\\n![Illustration of Acme Bank issuing a verifiable credential to Alice\u2019s wallet, and the wallet presenting the credential as proof of a bank account to a PFI Verifier.](/img/acme-bank-example.png)\\n\\nThe credential contains the issuer as Acme and the subject as Alice, as well as the claims, which are Alice\'s account number and full name.\\n\\nUpon request for proof of banking, Alice presents the Verifiable Credential that\'s cryptographically signed by both Alice as well as her bank.\\n\\nThis is an easy, machine-readable way to share credentials across the web. The Verifier does not know or trust Alice, but they do consider Acme trustworthy, and they have essentially vouched for Alice therefore distributing trust.\\n\\n## Decentralized Web Nodes\\n\\nToday, centralized entities act as our data stores. Applications hold all of our content and preferences on their servers.\\n\\n[Decentralized Web Nodes](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/) (DWNs) change this by allowing us to decouple our data from the applications that we use, and instead host our data ourselves in our own personal data stores.\\n\\n[BlueSky](https://blueskyweb.xyz/) is a good example; it\'s a decentralized version of Twitter that\'s in the works. With BlueSky, your tweets and your connections aren\'t stored with the application. They are stored with you. So you can present your content on any decentralized social media app you want, not just BlueSky.\\n\\nYour DWNs can hold both public and encrypted data. For example, in the case of a decentralized version of Twitter, you\'d want data like your tweets and your connections to be public but things like your DMs to be private.\\n\\n**Your decentralized web nodes do not live on the blockchain**. You can host your web nodes anywhere (your phone, computer, etc) and can replicate them across your devices and clouds and all data will be synced.\\n\\n![Decentralized Web Nodes is an emerging standard for data storage and relay that enables entities of any type (people, organizations, etc) to send and store encrypted or public messages and data, enabling a wide variety of decentralized apps and protocols to be built on top. Features of Decentralized Web Nodes include: universally addressable, replicated, secure, semantic discovery, async message threads, supports any identity type.](/img/features-graphic.png)\\n\\nWhile self-hosting your DWNs provides a means for decentralizing your data, we recognize some users will be more comfortable with others hosting their web nodes for convenience sake. We envision there will be vendors offering to host your web nodes for you. The good part about that is you can encrypt any private data so unlike today where cloud hosts can scan everything that you host there, you can still maintain some privacy even if you have your web nodes hosted by intermediaries.\\n\\nYour DWNs are associated with your Decentralized Identifiers and are listed in a DID document.\\n\\nNotice the `serviceEndpoint` section of the DID doc specifies service endpoints and provides URIs to the decentralized web nodes.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"@context\\": \\"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1\\",\\n  \\"id\\": \\"did:web:example.com:u:alice\\",\\n  \\"service\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"id\\": \\"#dwn\\",\\n      \\"type\\": \\"DecentralizedWebNode\\",\\n      //highlight-start\\n      \\"serviceEndpoint\\": {\\n        \\"nodes\\": [\\"https://dwn.example.com\\", \\"00:11:22:33:FF:EE\\"]\\n      }\\n      //highlight-end\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\"verificationMethod\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"id\\": \\"did:web:example.com:u:alice\\",\\n      \\"type\\": \\"Secp256k1VerificationKey2018\\",\\n      \\"controller\\": \\"did:web:example.com:u:alice\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\"authentication\\": [\\"did:web:example.com:u:alice\\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nGiven an application has the address to your DWN, they can send you a request for data.\\n\\nThis represents a request from an application to obtain all objects within a DWN that follow the `SocialMediaPosting` schema:\\n\\n```json\\n    POST https://dwn.example.com/\\n    BODY {\\n      \\"requestId\\": \\"c5784162-84af-4aab-aff5-f1f8438dfc3d\\",\\n      \\"target\\": \\"did:example:123\\",\\n      \\"messages\\": [\\n        {\\n          \\"descriptor\\": {\\n            \\"method\\": \\"CollectionsQuery\\",\\n            \\"schema\\": \\"https://schema.org/SocialMediaPosting\\"\\n          }\\n        },\\n        {...}\\n      ]\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nThe data within DWNs are JSON objects that follow a universal standard, thus making it possible for any application to discover and process the data given its semantic type.\\n\\nIf this data is public, those objects will be automatically returned to the application, and if the data is private, the node owner would need to grant the application access to that data.\\n\\n## Identity Wallets\\n\\nObviously all of this is pretty complicated, especially for non-technical users. So we need a simplistic, easy to use interface that will allow people to access and manage their identity.\\n\\nA well designed identity wallet would provide ways to manage the data stored in decentralized web nodes, the decentralized IDs and the context in which they should be used, verifiable credentials, and authorizations.\\n\\n![Identity wallets are mobile apps that provide UI and functionality to manage credentials and app data stored in Decentralized Web Nodes; sign, verify, discover, and present credentials to verifying parties; perform authentication and manage authorizations; support create, update, and recovery of DIDs across all supported DID Methods; maintain and enforce which DIDs are used with different people, apps, and services.](/img/identity-wallets.png)\\n\\n## Decentralized Web Apps\\n\\nWeb 5 enables developers to build decentralized web applications (DWAs) on top of it and it\u2019s all open source! You\'re free to use it as your foundation and focus your attention on what you really care about, your app. Web5 brings to DWAs what cloud and application servers bring to enterprise apps. It does the hard part. It brings decentralization. By building your apps on top of Web 5, you get decentralization and identity and data management as part of the platform.\\n\\nThis is definitely a fundamental change in how we exchange data, but it\'s not a total overhaul of the web we already know. This works like Progressive Web Apps, but you\'d add the decentralized web node SDK and then applications are free to really go serverless because the data isn\'t stored with them.\\n\\n![Illustration of PWAs compared to DWAs. PWAs comprise of a web app that uses a service worker to pull from local cache and a centralized app server; whereas DWAs comprise of a DWN SDK and a service worker that pull from local cache and Decentralized Web Nodes.](/img/pwa-dwa.png)\\n\\nThe sky\'s the limit to what you can build on top of this platform, but here are some cool basic examples.\\n\\n## Music Applications\\n\\nNo one likes recreating their music playlists over and over again for different apps. With Web 5, you wouldn\'t have to do that.\\n\\nIn this example, Groove has access to write to Alice\'s decentralized web node and adds a new entry.\\n\\nTidal has access to read from Alice\'s DWN, so can read the new entry that was added by Groove, and now Alice has her playlist readily available on both apps.\\n\\n![Illustration of Groove writing a new schema.org/MusicPlaylist object to Alice\u2019s remote DWN and Tidal, who has read ability, reading the MusicPlaylist entry that Groove added.](/img/music-to-my-ears.png)\\n\\nWith the continuous utilization of the data across apps, not only do Groove and Tidal get access to Alice\'s data, but they use it to improve her user experience, thus creating a stronger experience than Alice could have ever gotten had she not used this tech.\\n\\n## Travel Applications\\n\\nYour travel preferences, tickets, and reservations are scattered across so many different hotels, airlines, rental car agencies and travel apps, making it really difficult to coordinate. Heaven forbid there\'s any hiccup in the system such as a delayed flight. You end up trying to get in touch with the car rental place to let them know you\'ll be late for your reservation, and if it\'s really late, you\'d want to call the hotel to ask them not to give away your room. All while you\'re hustling and bustling at the airport.\\n\\nWeb 5 can help unify these various app experiences.\\n\\nIf Alice gives the hotel, the airline, and the rental car agency access to the `Reservation` and `Trip` objects in her DWN, they can react and adjust accordingly to any changes made.\\n\\n![Illustration: Alice grants her hotel, airline, and rental car provider the ability to add schema.org/Reservation objects to her collection of trip-related data and also grants any app she chooses access to reservations and tickets stored in her schema.org/Trip data to help her visualize her itinerary.](/img/hotel-travel-plans.png)\\n\\nThese are just a few applications that can be realized by building on top of Web 5. There\'s so many more possibilities once the web is truly decentralized the way it was always intended to be.\\n\\n## How to Get Involved\\n\\nWhile we\u2019re super excited about this technology, there\'s still lots of problems to be solved.
