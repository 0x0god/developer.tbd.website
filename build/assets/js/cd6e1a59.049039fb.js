A follower on TikTok can\u2019t be transferred outside of the platform, and a video on the social media giant is currently owned and stored on TikTok\u2019s servers.

They ask users to upload videos to TikTok servers and then store, sort, organize, and serve that content.

This would decouple platforms and distribution, meaning that the marketing power of individuals and businesses wouldn\u2019t be wholly subject to the whim of community guidelines or editorial discretion of platform owners. In this model, a TikTok ban would simply mean that TikTok\u2019s metadata - like counts, comments, and other analytics - would be stripped away, but the content and creator-follower relationships would persist.
