has happened! There have been a flurry of conventions, discussions, papers, standards, software, and industry wide adoption of technology based on the principles of SSI. The space is at its most mature, and only growing.</p><p class="my-6 copy"><a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-changes-name-to-block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Block</a>âs mission is economic empowerment. Historically, this has looked like building products and offering services such as <a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Square</a>, enabling millions of merchants <em>to take payments, manage staff, and conduct business in-store and online</em>, and <a href="https://cash.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CashApp</a>, which enables millions, especially the un and under-banked to send, spend, bank, and invest their money (and Bitcoin!). When <a href="https://www.tbd.website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TBD</a>, a new business unit at <a href="https://block.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Block</a> formed in 2021, we expanded on Blockâs mission, setting out to help create <em>a decentralized future that returns ownership and control over your finances, data, and identity</em>. TBDâs mission is strongly aligned with the principles of SSI.</p><p class="my-6 copy">To facilitate our mission, TBD launched <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web5</a>: a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols. Web5 takes SSI concepts, standards, and software and provides them as an opinionated bundle to enable all that self sovereignty and digital identity has to offer. What TBD is building for Web5 has a number of components today, and more tomorrow. Among those are the Self Sovereign Identity SDK and Self Sovereign Identity Service (SSI SDK, and SSI Service), Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN), and Identity Wallets. At the time of writing, all of these components are under active development. This was an intentional move by the team to adopt an âopen-by-defaultâ model, and include the community in the development of Web5 from the beginning.</p><p class="my-6 copy">Here weâll lay out the vision for a key component of Web5: Self Sovereign Identity. Specifically, how we at TBD are building standards based software in a community towards the goals of SSI and Web5. The two âSSIâ named projects â the SSI Service and SSI SDK â sit along side Decentralized Web Nodes, Identity Wallets, User Interfaces, and much more â but focus on a set of standards-based building blocks of the Web5 stack.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="software-mission">Software Mission<a href="#software-mission" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Software Mission" title="Direct link to Software Mission">â</a></h2><p class="my-6 copy"><strong class="font-bold text-primary-yellow">TBD is developing open source, standards-based software to facilitate Self Sovereign Identity on Web5.</strong></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-standards">Open Standards<a href="#open-standards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open Standards" title="Direct link to Open Standards">â</a></h3><p class="my-6 copy">The vision of SSI is realized via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard#:~:text=%22Open%20Standards%22%20are%20standards%20made,are%20intended%20for%20widespread%20adoption." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Standards</a>. Crucially, these standards are accessible to all: to view and to contribute. You may not be aware of it, but you interact with Open Standards every day: whether via web browsers, hardware you use and their underlying protocols, programming languages, audio files, internet and bluetooth devices, text documents, chat applications, encryption you use and so much more. Open Standards facilitate nearly every aspect of modern computation.</p><p class="my-6 copy">In the SSI space there a number of standards bodies that facilitate SSI-standard development.

Instead, we are focused on fostering a self-sustaining community focused on building and building on Web5. To facilitate this, we can expand our existing tools like adding sections of our <a href="https://forums.tbd.website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forums</a>, creating new <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> channels, creating new purpose-specific <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repositories</a> and investing in new tools for collaboration like an ideas board, job listing page, or a Web5 wiki. Iâd love to see a Web5 incubator similar to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Y Combinator</a> that facilitates those building on Web5. The futureâs possibilities are endless, and we are eager to adapt to the evolving needs of the community.</p><p class="my-6 copy">Sometimes, we may need more rigorous structure. As such, we are interested in forming working groups in the Web5 community where it makes sense. The output of these groups could be industry coordination, use-case building, software development, or even standards-related work that can be contributed to existing standards bodies. TBD has kicked off one such group to date around Credentials, first focused on creating a path for Know Your Customer (KYC) Credentials. This group already follows such a pattern: having built out <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/credentials-working-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use-case documentation in GitHub</a>, having a purpose-specific <a href="https://discord.com/channels/937858703112155166/969682739005624412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord channel</a>, and <a href="https://forums.tbd.website/c/self-sovereign-identity-users/credentials-working-group/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum category</a>. Soon weâll adapt this group to a more âoffice hoursâ-style format, allowing anyone in the community to show off their work, ask for assistance, and help shape our project development roadmaps. </p><p class="my-6 copy">Today we have one <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub org</a>, run by the TBD team. We will open up roles for community management. Creating light processes for community-driven moderation and maintenance (e.g. managing pull requests, issues, labels, and milestones), in addition to having projects and repositories started and managed entirely by members of the community. One such idea we are considering is for a new GitHub organization for the âWeb5 Communityâ to foster and highlight community-driven efforts. Weâre additionally looking to launch an Incubation program that gives a formal path towards recognizing and promoting the work that begins in a grassroots manner in our community. We plan on making the rest of our tooling community-driven as well: today this means Discord and the Forums, tomorrow it will be a lot more!</p><p class="my-6 copy">While this is something we are focused on internally, it is crucial that you as community members are able to make suggestions, plans, and directly influence change. Reach out on Discord, our Forums, gain mindshare for your ideas, and we will help make them a reality.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source">Open Source<a href="#open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open Source" title="Direct link to Open Source">â</a></h2><p class="my-6 copy">The foundations of Web5 are <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a>. This means that its source code is publicly available and, as stewards, we rely on external contributionâWeb5 is only successful with the full innovation of a global community. Certainly there are cases where code cannot be open source for various reasons: this applies to the TBD business as well as members of our community. We do not mandate open source, but it is a guiding principle. We believe in the power of open, and all that comes with it. The more open Web5 can be, the better it will be.</p><p class="my-6 copy">Projects in the TBD GitHub may originate at TBD, or through the community (on our Discord, Forums). Today, the TBD team is acting as the primary steward and maintainer of all projects. As the community matures, we expect it to take the lead and for TBD to assume a higher-level maintainer role. We imagine this ends up looking like more community-driven projects, community members gaining merge and moderation access, and growing a diverse set of contributors interested in a broad set of use cases to be built on Web5. More broadly, we want to push forward to a world where TBD does not have the only, or final say on any Web5 decision: <strong class="font-bold text-primary-yellow">decentralization is a strength in the development of Web5</strong>.</p><p class="my-6 copy">This transition is only made possible by active engagement from the community. It is the reason our code is open, and we have set up avenues for engagement. We look towards the community to engage with TBD and others, and push for the future we wish to see built.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="software-vision">Software Vision<a href="#software-vision" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Software Vision" title="Direct link to Software Vision">â</a></h2><p class="my-6 copy"><strong class="font-bold text-primary-yellow">TBD is fostering a set of community-driven, open source, standards-based software to facilitate Self Sovereign Identity on Web5.</strong></p><p class="my-6 copy">We want to realize the vision of the Web5 community: <em>to build pragmatic standards-based software that serves a wide variety of needs</em>. The software shall not be tied to any specific entity, nor, without good reason, exclude possibilities within the SSI space. Balancing both feature-richness and complexity we must work closely with our users to design software that meets the needs of all who wish to be on Web5. We think in terms of toolkits, composed of the purpose-specific tools in them. These toolkits exist in a hierarchy of abstractions from which powerful, intuitive, and human-centric software can be built.</p><p class="my-6 copy">The software must be designed in a flexible, modular manner. This means interfaces that feature a default implementation or two, but can be extended to facilitate integration into many systems (e.g. swapping out databases, encryption methods, credential formats as needed). The software is intended to be built on open standards in the SSI space. The standards space is fast-changing and there may be cases where we use ill-defined and ill-supported standards; we must be able to favor practicality and working implementations over robust standards with a commitment to see the standards through. There may be cases where we use our software to innovate past the current state of these standards and open the opportunity to contribute back to existing standards and standards bodies.</p><p class="my-6 copy">We recognize that the SSI ecosystem is full of competing and developing standards. Often this can feel like developing against a set of moving targets and promises of feature sets. Thereâs a lot of information to grok and everyone has an opinionâthis is a good thing! It can be difficult to pick winners, and even more difficult to choose between multiple standards that appear to do the same thing: we do not want to create a Swiss Army knife that contains five different types of scissors, weâd rather it contain one (or maybe two) scissors that get the job done well 99% of the time. We favor evaluating the addition of features and standards on a case-by-case basis, and looking towards implementations of standards and features that are well-reasoned, with committed developers. Bonus points if there is already demonstrated usage and interoperability.</p><p class="my-6 copy">We also recognize that the SSI ecosystem uses a wide set of tools, languages, and technologies: working across web browsers, mobile applications, backend servers, ledgers, and more. For languages weâve started with <a href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go</a> (for the SSI SDK and SSI Service) because of its robust cryptographic support, speed, ability to be compiled to <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WASM</a>, and, above all else, simplicity. It is crucial that the code we write is approachable to encourage contribution. Simple and clear is always preferred over clever. The future is multi-language, and multi-platform. We welcome initiatives for improving multi-language and multi-platform support, and are open to fostering them into our GitHub organization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ssi-sdk">SSI SDK<a href="#ssi-sdk" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SSI SDK" title="Direct link to SSI SDK">â</a></h2><p class="my-6 copy">Named <code>ssi-sdk</code>, this SDK encapsulates a set of standards related to <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self Sovereign Identity</a>. The <code>ssi-sdk</code> intends to provide flexible functionality based on a set of standards-based primitives for building decentralized identity applications in a modular manner: with limited dependencies between components.</p><p class="my-6 copy">Primarily, the SDK serves to support Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials and their associated standards. Interacting with Decentralized Identifiers: resolving identifiers, signing, verifying, encrypting, and decrypting data using cryptographic keys found in DID Documents. Interacting with Verifiable Credentials: creating and using data schemas, facilitating credential application, issuance, and exchange.</p><p class="my-6 copy">The SDK is an active work in progress, and can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TBD GitHub</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ssi-service">SSI Service<a href="#ssi-service" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SSI Service" title="Direct link to SSI Service">â</a></h2><p class="my-6 copy">The Self Sovereign Identity Service (SSIS) facilitates all things relating to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Verifiable Credentials</a> â in a box! The service is a part of a larger <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decentralized Web Platform</a> architecture. The SSI Service is a JSON-API web service that wraps the <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ssi-sdk</a> to facilitate user-focused interactions on Web5. The service is intended to interact with user interfaces, wallets, decentralized web nodes, and other web infrastructure. </p><p class="my-6 copy">By taking the lower-level building blocks exposed by the SDK, the service is intended to drastically lower the barrier to entry for any individual or organization interesting in building on the Web5 stack. Like the SDK, it is agnostic to any specific business or use case, and design to be pluggable into external infrastructure whether existing or new. </p><p class="my-6 copy">The service is assumed to be run by a single organization and assumes external authentication and authorization. The service assumes no infrastructure requirements and is flexible to multiple deployment models, databases, key management solutions, and user interfaces. We expect that a wide array of users and use cases will use and build on top of the service, creating layers of abstraction and intermediation for processing business logic, handling user accounts, and so on.</p><p class="my-6 copy">The service is an active work in progress, and can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TBD GitHub</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-features-are-developed">How Features are Developed<a href="#how-features-are-developed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Features are Developed" title="Direct link to How Features are Developed">â</a></h2><p class="my-6 copy">We are in the early days of Web5. By intention, weâve announced our ideas and projects way before they are ready for an alpha release, let alone inclusion in a production-ready application. Transparency is an asset in sharing our thinking and gaining mindshare for what we are building. As such, there are many forks in the road fast-approaching. To move past these forks, and the forks after those I introduce some light process to guide principled decision making:</p><ol><li class="my-4">Features shall be developed using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Socratic method</a>: making statements, interrogating them, asking <em>whys</em> and <em>hows</em>, being intellectually honest with risk, uncertainty, consider second, third and n-order effects.</li><li class="my-4">All new feature proposals shall include a light design document outlining desired functionality, end-user utility, prior art, room for improvement and next steps, risks and mitigations, considerations, and open questions.</li><li class="my-4">A quorum of project maintainers shall review and progress feature proposals in a timely manner.</li></ol><p class="my-6 copy">Templates for the aforementioned process have been created on each GitHub repository. I encourage you to create GitHub issues and Forum discussions to explore thinking, and revise designs before going forth with a contribution.</p><p class="my-6 copy">For templates on feature development, philosophies on versioning and releases, and more information view our GitHub documentation: </p><p class="my-6 copy"><a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSI Service GitHub Docs</a> | <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSI SDK GitHub Docs</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-goal">The Goal<a href="#the-goal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Goal" title="Direct link to The Goal">â</a></h2><p class="my-6 copy">I believe in setting public and ambitious <em>measurable</em> goals.
