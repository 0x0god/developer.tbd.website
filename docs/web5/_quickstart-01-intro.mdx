# Web5 in 5️⃣ minutes

We’re going to build a decentralized application on the Web5 platform - in under 5 minutes.

We’ll show you how to use features like messaging, reading, and writing to your personal data store.

Let’s go! 🚀

This QuickStart is noted with lots of NOTES

...where appropriate, specifically referencing widgets that Devin has created. Those
are [runnable here](https://moonlit-centaur-0d7b4f.netlify.app/), in 
[this repo](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-quickstart-widgets/blob/main/index.html)
temporarily, until we can slice them into React components and embed them within this page context here.
When done, they'll be the interactive portion of the code we show as we go, walking the user through 
what they're doing (prose), how (code), and what it may look like (runnable widgets) all on the page.
