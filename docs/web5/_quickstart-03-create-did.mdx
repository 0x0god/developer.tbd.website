## 2. Create Web5 instance:

Thereâ€™s only one class for all Web5 operations

```js
const web5 = new Web5
```

## 3. Create a Decentralized Identifier (DID):

:::info
A [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/),
is an W3C specification for an address representing who you are on the decentralized web. You 
can [learn more about them here](/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers) as 
a core concept behind Web5.
:::

In the world of Web5, a user's unique identifier, like an email address, is called a DID.

Why do we need a DID?

Since we're now building decentralized apps we need an identifier that isn't tied to a centralized authority.
It can be used to identify and associate a user's data across any platform.

We can create a DID using the Web5 API:

```js
let did = await web5.did.create('ion');
```

This creates a new DID using the `ion` [method name](/docs/glossary#did-method---ion).
