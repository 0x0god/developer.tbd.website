## Quickstart

1. Import the Web5 API into your application:

```
import { Web5 } from '@tbd54566975/web5'
```

#### Using CDN directly

If not using NPM, you may import the `Web5` class from the library directly on the CDN.

```JavaScript
import { Web5 } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tbd54566975/web5@0.3.1/dist/browser.min.js'
```

</p>
</details>

2. Create Web5 instance:

Thereâ€™s only one class for all Web5 operations

```js
const web5 = new Web5
```

3. Create a Decentralized Identifier (DID):

In the world of Web5, your unique identifier, like an email address, is called a DID.
