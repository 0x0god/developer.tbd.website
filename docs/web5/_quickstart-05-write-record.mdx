## 5. Write to Decentralized Web Node

Now you’re able to write / store your app's data in the user's Decentralized Web Node (DWN).

The user's DWN is their personal data store - a platform for messages, pictures, videos, medical records, and just about any content. Your app does not need to store the user's data - it should be stored in their DWN. This is how the user retains ownership over their content. 

Through permissions, users can decide which apps can read, write, and delete content from their DWN. In the near future, users will have the opportunity to replicate their DWN across their devices.

A user can host their DWN in mulitple locations. The Web5 JS library is both browser and Node.js compliant, meaning you can use the same APIs on both client side and serverside. 

```js
const data = 'Hello Web5';

let writeResult = await web5.dwn.records.write(did.id, {
    author: did.id,
    data,
    message: {
        schema: 'test',
        dataFormat: 'image/png',
    },
});
```

:::note

The `dataFormat` value isn’t limited to `image/png`; it can be any `MIME` type.
