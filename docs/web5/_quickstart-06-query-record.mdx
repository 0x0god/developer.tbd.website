## 6. Query

Here’s how you’re able to query data in a DWN.

Querying a DWN allows you to search records depending on the filter params you pass to it. In the code snippet below, we're querying a DWN for messages that match the schema "test". Note that you don't have to query based on schema, there are many different attributes you can use to query, such as `dataFormat`, `protocol`, `contextId` 

```js
let queryResult = await
    web5.dwn.records.query(did.id, {
        author: did.id,
        message: {
            filter: {
            schema: 'test',
        },
    },
});
```

Through querying we can find some information about the data you just wrote:
