Here’s how you’re able to query anything you've saved in your DWN.

:note: The dataFormat value isn’t limited to image/png; it can be any MIME type.

```js
let queryResult = await
    web5.dwn.records.query(did.id, {
        author: did.id,
        message: {
            filter: {
            schema: 'test',
        },
    },
});
console.log('query result', queryResult);
```
