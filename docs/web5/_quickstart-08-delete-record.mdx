## 8. Deleting messages from your DWN

Data can be deleted from DWNs if you have permission to do so. Similar to reading, we're using the `recordId` to remove the record.

```js
let deleteResult = await web5.dwn.records.delete(did.id, {
    author: did.id,
    message: {
        recordId: queryResult.entries[0].recordId,
        },
    });
```
