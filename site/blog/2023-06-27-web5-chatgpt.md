[Web5](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5/) introduces a paradigm shift in the way we build applications. App-centric logins and data storage are replaced with decentralized identity and personal data stores.

While Web5 abstracts away a lot of the complexity of building decentralized apps, it would be nice to have a helping hand to answer all of your Web5 questions.

That's why we've created a Web5 Assistant in the form of a ChatGPT plugin. The Web5 Assistant is built on GPT-4 and was trained on all of our available documentation.

So, instead of digging through several tutorials to find the one piece of information you need, simply ask your question to the Web5 Assistant and it will be happy to help you.

:::note
To add a plugin to ChatGPT, you must be a [ChatGPT Plus subscriber](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus). Find more info on [installing ChatGPT plugins](https://www.producthunt.com/stories/best-chatgpt-plugins-how-to-add-install-use).

After installing the Web5 Assistant plugin, you can use ChatGPT as normal, and include Web5's knowledge base when answering your questions.

For example, maybe you need insight on what's a DID?

![what is a DID](/img/chatgpt-plugin-what-is-a-did.png)

Or perhaps you need assistance with an API call.

Or you can get into more complex things like asking the Web5 Assistant to generate a protocol for the app you're building!

So, as you can see, the plugin can help you with all things Web5. And of course, we've [opened sourced](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-chatgpt-plugin) the knowledge base so feel free to contribute anything we may have missed.
