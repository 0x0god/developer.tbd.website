![Why Would Companies Embrace Web5?](/img/blog-companies-embrace-web5.png)

Web5 prescribes that users maintain control of their content by [decoupling their data](/blog/what-is-web5#decentralized-web-nodes) from the applications that they use.

I'm frequently asked why major companies who have made billions of dollars off of our data would buy into this model?

This is a fair question. Let's dig into it.

<!--truncate-->

## Data is a liability.

Holding people's data was all fun and games. Until it wasn't. By custodying data, companies are responsible for all sorts of regulations. Not only are they responsible, but the liability is biting into the very profits that once seemed so alluring. 

### DMCA
Consider the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Hosting content that violates copyright laws may lead to legal battles, and the enforcement of the DMCA can require companies to enact costly compliance measures. 

Just ask YouTube, which has had to develop sophisticated content management systems to respond to DMCA takedown notices.

Twitch has received a significant number of DMCA takedown requests for copyrighted music within streams. The platform was criticized for how it handled the situation, leaving many streamers confused and worried about potential copyright strikes.

Soundcloud has faced several controversies related to DMCA takedown requests, particularly from record labels claiming copyright infringement. Artists have sometimes found their own original content taken down.

### Legal Cases
But the DMCA is just the tip of the iceberg. When data gets personal, as it so often does, companies can find themselves caught in the middle of even more delicate legal situations. 

From private messages to social media posts, the data hosted can become the subject of subpoenas and legal requests from law enforcement and other government entities. 

Remember the case involving [Apple and the FBI](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/17/467096705/apple-the-fbi-and-iphone-encryption-a-look-at-whats-at-stake), where the tech giant was asked to unlock a user's iPhone for an investigation? Or the [request to Meta for the private messages of a teenager](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/12/1117092169/nebraska-cops-used-facebook-messages-to-investigate-an-alleged-illegal-abortion) whom the government suspected of having an illegal abortion? Or Twitter's frequent transparency reports detailing government and copyright takedown requests?

Companies are being forced to walk a tightrope, balancing user privacy, legal obligations, and their own interests. This all comes with real risks. Failure to comply with a legal request can lead to hefty fines and reputational damage, while too much compliance can erode user trust.

And let's not forget - none of these companies have any interest in being involved with these political affairs.

So, is data still a golden goose for companies? Perhaps, but it's a goose that now comes with shackles and a court summons. 

### GDPR
But wait, let's not forget about the GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation. This is another thorn in the side of companies who are custodying user data. 

You think the DMCA's tough? This European rule, which has been in place since 2018, can cut right through a company's bottom line. GDPR fines can reach up to 4% of a company's annual global turnover or â‚¬20 million, whichever is higher. Meta felt this sting to the tune of â‚¬1.2 billion, and Amazon took a hit of â‚¬746 million.

And it's not just the big players who should be wary. If you're dealing with European citizens' data, GDPR cares, and it doesn't matter where in the world you're located. Miss a step, mishandle information, or suffer a data breach, and you'll find yourself dealing with regulators, and they lead with a heavy hand.

Data breaches used to be like shadows, lurking and ominous. Now, under GDPR, they're like flashing neon signs. A company has to report specific breaches within 72 hours. Miss that window, and you're in for even more fines and a potential public relations nightmare.

### Web5 Offers a Way Out
Web5's model of giving users control of their data is looking more and more like a lifeboat to many of these companies. By taking the responsibility off the corporations and putting it into the hands of the individuals, companies can focus on their primary business and less on the political, legal, and financial consequences that come with hosting user data.

Let's face it, the data game has changed. It's looking less and less like a treasure hunt, and more and more like a minefield. The question is no longer just about profits; it's about sustainable, responsible business practices in a digital age where data isn't just an asset - it's a liability filled with risks.

I hope, by now, you're asking yourself "well, how do we ensure people aren't hosting illegal data in their personal datastores?". C'mon, don't let me sell you an easy, breezy pipe dream ðŸ˜‚. The truth of the matter is decentralization is hard and it's not just the tech behind it. 

In the centralized model, law enforcement can target a single entity, such as YouTube or Twitter (by the way, this sentence alone answers why companies would embrace Web5. They don't want this burden!).

But decentralization scatters the data across various individual data stores. There's no single point of failure, but there's also no single point of accountability. 

Would law enforcement have to approach each user individually? And if so, how would they even identify these users? It's a scenario filled with legal, ethical, and technical challenges.

Web5 offers an exciting possibility for user control and privacy, but it also opens up a new frontier that challenges our existing understanding of law and governance. 

What is clear is that the transition towards a decentralized web isn't just a technological shift; it's a legal and societal one as well. The questions it raises about accountability, enforcement, and individual rights are ones that we, as a society, will have to answer together.
