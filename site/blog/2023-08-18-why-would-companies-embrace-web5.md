![Why Would Companies Embrace Web5?](/img/blog-companies-embrace-web5.png)

Web5 prescribes that users maintain control of their content by [decoupling their data](/blog/what-is-web5#decentralized-web-nodes) from the applications that they use. I'm frequently asked why major companies who have made billions of dollars off of our data would buy into this model? This is a fair question. Let's dig into it.

<!--truncate-->

### Data is a liability.

Holding people's data was all fun and games. Until it wasn't. By collecting and storing user data, companies are responsible for adhering to all sorts of regulations. Not only are they responsible, but the liability is biting into the very profits that once seemed so alluring. 

### DMCA
Consider the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Hosting content that violates copyright laws may lead to legal battles, and the enforcement of the DMCA can require companies to enact costly compliance measures. 

Just ask YouTube, which has had to develop sophisticated content management systems to respond to DMCA takedown notices.

Twitch has received a significant number of DMCA takedown requests for copyrighted music within streams. The platform was criticized for how it handled the situation, leaving many streamers confused and worried about potential copyright strikes.

Soundcloud has faced several controversies related to DMCA takedown requests, particularly from record labels claiming copyright infringement. Artists have sometimes found their own original content taken down.

### Legal Cases
But the DMCA is just the tip of the iceberg. When data gets personal, as it so often does, companies can find themselves caught in the middle of even more delicate legal situations. 

From private messages to social media posts, the data hosted can become the subject of subpoenas and legal requests from law enforcement and other government entities. 

Remember the case involving [Apple and the FBI](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/17/467096705/apple-the-fbi-and-iphone-encryption-a-look-at-whats-at-stake), where the tech giant was asked to unlock a user's iPhone for an investigation? Or the [request to Meta for the private messages of a teenager](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/12/1117092169/nebraska-cops-used-facebook-messages-to-investigate-an-alleged-illegal-abortion) whom the government suspected of having an illegal abortion? Or Twitter's frequent transparency reports detailing government and copyright takedown requests?

Companies are being forced to walk a tightrope, balancing user privacy, legal obligations, and their own interests. This all comes with real risks. Failure to comply with a legal request can lead to hefty fines and reputational damage, while giving away data on a whim can erode user trust.

And let's not forget - none of these companies have any interest in being involved with these political affairs.

So, is data still a golden goose for companies? Perhaps, but it's a goose that now comes with shackles and a court summons. 


### GDPR
But wait, let's not forget about the GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation. This is another thorn in the sides of companies who are hosting user data. 

You think the DMCA's tough? This rule, which has been in place in Europe since 2018 and [gaining momentum in the US under similar legislation](https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/), can cut right through a company's bottom line. GDPR fines can reach up to 4% of a company's annual global turnover or €20 million, whichever is higher. Meta felt this sting to the tune of €1.2 billion, and Amazon took a hit of €746 million.

And it's not just the big players who should be wary. If you're dealing with European citizens' data, GDPR cares, and it doesn't matter where in the world you're located. Miss a step, mishandle information, or suffer a data breach, and you'll find yourself dealing with regulators who lead with a heavy hand.

Data breaches used to be like shadows, lurking and ominous. Now, under GDPR, they're like flashing neon signs. A company has to report specific breaches within 72 hours. Miss that window, and you're in for even more fines and a potential public relations nightmare.

### Web5 Offers a Way Out
Web5's model of giving users control of their data is looking like a lifeboat to many of these companies. By granting users autonomy over their data, companies transition from the role of “data controller” to that of “data processor/service provider”, incurring fewer legal obligations.

With this reduction of responsibility, companies can focus on their primary business and less on the political, legal, and financial consequences that come with hosting user data.

Let's face it, the data game has changed. It's looking less and less like a treasure hunt, and more and more like a minefield. The question is no longer just about profits; it's about sustainable, responsible business practices in a digital age where data isn't just an asset - it's a liability filled with risks.

But, it’s essential to frame this correctly; the essence of Web5 isn't about ditching responsibility but about streamlining operations while giving users true ownership of their data.

In the era of Web5, companies no longer need to act like banks, holding onto your data (akin to your money) in a vault. Instead, with Web5, each individual gets their own secure vault for their data, deciding who can access it and when. It’s a shift from centralized trust to decentralized assurance.

This isn’t about creating anarchy or complicating law enforcement’s job. In fact, over 40 governments worldwide are already adopting the technology that Web5 utilizes. As the world leans more into decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, platforms echoing Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN) will be more prevalent.

Decentralization doesn’t mean chaos or disorder. It means establishing a new framework where individuals are empowered, yet responsibilities are clear. 
Just as the internet itself has always adapted to accommodate laws and regulations, so will Web5, aligning seamlessly with legal and societal standards.


### Opportunity for New Business Models

Innovation is the lifeblood of the technology industry, and with the rise of Web5, businesses are primed to pivot their models to a user-centric approach. Historically, companies that garnered large user bases dominated the market, leveraging their numbers to continue growing. Their approach often emphasized the quantity of users over the quality of service, leading to predatory models that locked users in and made switching to competitors a daunting task.

However, Web5 democratizes the playing field in a profound way.

**Competing on Service, Not User Base Size**

With the shift in paradigm where users control their own data, the depth of a company's user base becomes less of a significant competitive advantage. Instead, the emphasis moves to the quality of service that a business offers. This isn't just about the interface or user experience; it's about the integrity of the service, its respect for user autonomy, and its capacity to innovate in a space where users have more say.

For companies, this might seem daunting at first glance. Why invest in a model that seems to take away their primary competitive advantage? The answer is two-fold:

**1. Focus on Core Competencies**

By emphasizing the quality of service, businesses can hone in on what they do best. Instead of allocating resources to retain data and manage its associated risks, companies can prioritize enhancing their product offerings. This is a shift back to basics – offering a stellar service or product that people genuinely want.

**2. Less Predatory Business Practices** 

In a world of Web5, companies that try to lock users in by hoarding their data will quickly find themselves unattractive to users. Instead, companies that embrace open, transparent, and user-centric practices will thrive. This encourages an ethical approach to business that not only benefits users but also enhances a company's reputation in the long run.

**Innovation and the Broader Business Landscape**

Web5 opens the doors for a surge of innovative applications and platforms. With users in control of their data, there's a wealth of untapped potential waiting to be explored. This benefits the broader business community, fostering a more dynamic and competitive market environment.

For instance, consider the rise of new platforms that cater to niche markets, or applications that leverage user data in previously unimaginable ways – but always with the user's consent and control. The market will see a wave of creativity, anchored by the values that Web5 upholds.


Embracing Web5 is not just a move towards a more ethical and user-centric internet. It's a strategic decision for businesses, enabling them to thrive in a future where quality, innovation, and ethics are paramount. As the online world continues to evolve, businesses that align with the values of Web5 will position themselves at the leading edge of the next technological shift.
