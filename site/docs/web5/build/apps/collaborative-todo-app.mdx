# Build a Decentralized Collaborative Todo App with Nuxt and Web5

In the [Build a Todo App](/todo-app-tutorial) tutorial, you learnt how to build a basic single-user decentralized todo app with `web5.js` and `Vue.js`.

For this tutorial, we will be expanding on the core features introduced with the todo app and build out a collaborative app that allows multiple users work on the same todo list.

## What you will learn
- Enforcing permissions or authorization on records through protocols.
- Sending and sharing updates across multiple users' Decentralized Web Nodes.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have an understanding of protocols, DWN to DWN communication and how to build a collaborative app on the Decentralized Web.

## What you will build
Bob and Alice are two friends that love doing things together. They often have specific goals and a bunch of tasks each of them have to complete to achieve this goal. They have decided to build a todo app that allows them to collaborate on their tasks and keep track of their progress while also being able to have their tasks on other tools they use. They have decided to use the Decentralized Web to build this app so they can have full control of their data and not have to worry about their data being sold to third parties.

## Getting the Skeleton App

You can follow along with this tutorial using your own layout, or you can use the starter project. As you go through the tutorial, you can add logic to the methods and update the UI.

### üìù Task

To access the starter code, follow the instructions below or explore the project directly in CodeSandbox.

## Setting up the App

Add `Web5` to package.json in the `dependencies` section:

<PackageJson />

Install the dependencies and get the project running:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should now have the app running on ['http://localhost:3000'](http://localhost:3000).

## App Architecture
We are building a ['NuxtJS App'](https://nuxt.com/) using the `pages/` folder. We have
- `pages/index.vue` - The home page of the app.
- `pages/todos/_id.vue` - The page for viewing a todo list.
- `assets/shared-todo-protocol.json`: A JSON file defining the protocol used for sharing to-do lists.

Our shared todo app will have a few features necessary to be implemented. We will be building out the following features:

- Creating a todo list with another user.
- Displaying all todo lists with different users.
- Adding tasks to a todo list.
- Marking tasks as completed.

## Initialize Constants and Variables

Open `pages/index.vue` and add the following code to the other imports:

```js
import { Web5 } from "@web5/api";
```

First we'll set up instances to hold data you'll use throughout your application.

Copy the following block and paste under all `import` statements in `pages/index.vue`:

```js
let web5;
let myDid;

// The lists of existing todo lists
const sharedList = ref([]);
```

The `web5` object is the single entry point for all Web5 operations. You've also set up a `sharedList` array to hold our shared lists, and a variable to remember the app user's decentralized identifier (DID) as `myDid`.

## Initialize Web5
The first time a user accessess your Shared Todo app,  you‚Äôll need to handle creating an ‚Äúaccount‚Äù for them - this means ensuring they have a DID and DWN available to access their app data. Once they come back for subsequent sessions, you‚Äôll want to fetch and load that data for them.

Add to `pages/index.vue`:

```js
onBeforeMount(async () => {
    ({ web5, did: myDID } = await Web5.connect());
});
```

## Setting Permissions and authorizations - Configuring protocols
[Protocols]('docs/web5/learn/protocols') help define both the data schema and the data permissions as it relates to a certain application or use case. It details what objects are stored as part of the application and who has what permissions on these objects.

Create a new file called `shared-todo-protocol.json` under the `assets/` folder.

```json
{
  "protocol": "https://didcomm.org/shared-todo",
  "published": true,
  "types": {
    "list": {
      "schema": "https://didcomm.org/shared-todo/schemas/list.json",
      "dataFormats": ["application/json"]
    },
    "todo": {
      "schema": "https://didcomm.org/shared-todo/schemas/todo.json",
      "dataFormats": ["application/json"]
    }
  },
  "structure": {
    "list": {
      "$actions": [
        {
          "who": "anyone",
          "can": "read"
        },
        {
          "who": "anyone",
          "can": "write"
        }
      ],
      "todo": {
        "$actions": [
          {
            "who": "author",
            "of": "list",
            "can": "write"
          },
          {
            "who": "recipient",
            "of": "list",
            "can": "write"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Here we are defining the objects that we want to use in our app - `list` and `todo` with who has what permissions.

Anyone can read and write a list. The author and recipient of a list can write to the todo list.

To implement this protocol, we have to install it in our app for any of the users.

In `pages/index.vue`, Add the protocol from the json.

```js
import sharedTodoProtocol from "~/assets/shared-todo-protocol.json";
```

```js
const configureProtocol = async () => {
    const { protocols, status } = await web5.dwn.protocols.query({
        message: {
            filter: {
                protocol: protocolDefinition.protocol,
            }
        }
    });

    if(status.code !== 200) {
        alert('Error querying protocols');
        console.error('Error querying protocols', status);
        return;
    }

    if(protocols.length > 0) {
        console.log('Protocol already exists');
        return;
    }

    // configure protocol on local DWN
    const { status: configureStatus, protocol } = await web5.dwn.protocols.configure({
        message: {
            definition: protocolDefinition,
        }
    });

    console.log('Protocol configured', configureStatus, protocol);

    // configuring protocol on remote DWN
    const { status: configureRemoteStatus } = protocol.send(myDID);
    console.log('Protocol configured on remote DWN', configureRemoteStatus);
}
```

- First we query the list of existing protocols on the DWN.
- If the protocol already exists, we return.
- If the protocol does not exist, we configure it on the local DWN and send it to the remote DWN.


Once this is done, we add the `configureProtocol` function to the `onBeforeMount` function.

```js
onBeforeMount(async () => {
    ({ web5, did: myDID } = await Web5.connect());

    await configureProtocol()
});
```

Right now, we have no existing lists, so we need to create one.

We have our variables already declared, so we can add the following function to `pages/index.vue`:

```js
const newTodo = ref({
    title: '',
    description: '',
    recipientDID: '',
});

const sharedList = ref([]);
```

Now we proceed to create the `createSharedList` function.

```js
// pages/index.vue
<script setup>
...
const createSharedList = async () => {
    let recipientDID = newTodo.value.recipientDID;
    const sharedListData = {
        "@type": "list",
        "title": newTodo.value.title,
        "description": newTodo.value.description,
        "author": myDID,
        "recipient": newTodo.value.recipientDID,
    }

    newTodo.value = { title: '', description: '', userId: '', alias: '' }

    try {
        const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({
            data: sharedListData,
            message: {
                protocol: protocolDefinition.protocol,
                protocolPath: 'list',
                schema: protocolDefinition.types.list.schema,
                dataFormat: protocolDefinition.types.list.dataFormats[0],
                recipient: recipientDID
            }
        });


        const data = await record.data.json();
        const list = {record, data, id: record.id};

        sharedList.value.push(list);
        showForm.value = false

        const { status: sendStatus } = await record.send(recipientDID);

        if (sendStatus.code !== 202) {
            console.log("Unable to send to target did:" + sendStatus);
            return;
        }
        else {
            console.log("Shared list sent to recipient");
        }
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        return;
    }

}
...
</script>
```

To break this down, we are creating a new list with the following properties:
- `@type`: The type of object we are creating. In this case, it is a list.
- `title`: The title of the list.
- `description`: The description of the list.
- `author`: The DID of the author of the list.
- `recipient`: The DID of the recipient of the list.

Then we pass all this to our `web5.dwn.records.create` function to create the list. Along with the data, we have to pass the protocol definition to the function. This ensures all our permissions and structure is enforced on the data we pass.

Now we have to ensure that the recipient also receives this new list data. And for that, we use `record.send()`.

```js
    const { status: sendStatus } = await record.send(recipientDID);
```

But how do users get to easily copy and share their own DIDs with other users? We are going to implement a Copy DID feature.

```js
const copyDID = async() => {
    await navigator.clipboard.writeText(myDID);
    alert('DID copied to clipboard');
}
```

And in the `<template>` section, we update the header to include the copy DID button.

```html
<header class="flex-col text-center mb-4">
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Shared Todo</h1>
    <p>Manage a set of todos towards your goals with friends.</p>
    <button v-if="myDID" class="btn" id="copy-did" @click="copyDID">Copy your DID</button>
</header>
```


## Displaying all todo lists with different users

Using our `onBeforeMount()` method, we've been able to initialize web5, and configure our protocol. We also use this method to fetch existing lists from the DWN.

```js
// pages/index.vue
onBeforeMount(async () => {
    ...

// Fetch shared todo lists.
    const{ records } = await web5.dwn.records.query({
        message: {
            filter: {
                schema: protocolDefinition.types.list.schema,
            },
            dateSort: 'createdAscending'
        }
    });

    console.log("Saved records", records);

    // add entry to sharedList
    for (let record of records) {
        const data = await record.data.json();
        const list = {record, data, id: record.id};
        sharedList.value.push(list);
    }
...
});
```

We are querying the DWN for all records that match the schema of our protocol. We then add each record to our `sharedList` array.


This is what our app now looks like:

* TODO: Add image of app

We have completed the first feature of our app. We can now create todolists and share them with another user.

## Adding tasks to a todo list
The next part of our project involves adding specific todos to each list. We want both participants of the list to be able to add todos, but only the author of each task can mark it as done. This behaviour is enforced by the protocols that we added earlier.

Using Nuxt Link, we are able to navigate to our list page by passing the `listId` as a url paramete e.g `localhost:3000/todos/[id]`. This is why we have `pages/todos/[id].vue` in our project to dynamically render based on the list we open.

## Fetching specific list details
In our dynamic todo page, we can reconnect to Web5 by importing both the sdk and protocolDefinition document again so they can be reused.

```js
import { Web5 } from "@web5/api";
import sharedTodoProtocol from "~/assets/shared-todo-protocol.json";
```

We need to fetch the list details from the DWN. We get the list Id from the url parameter, connect to Web5 and use the listId to query the DWN for the list.

```js

const route = useRoute();
const listId = ref(route.params.id);

let web5;
let myDID;

onBeforeMount(async () => {
    ({ web5, did: myDID } = await Web5.connect({
        sync: '5s'
    }));
    console.log("this is your DID", myDID);

    // fetch shared list details.
    const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.read({
        message: {
            recordId: listId.value
        }
    })

    todoList = await record.data.json();

    fetchingListInfo.value = false;
});
```

We update the `todoList` variable with the data from the DWN which we already have showing up on our page.

## Fetching tasks from a todo list
Every list comes with it's own tasks. And we can fetch this also in the `onBeforeMount()` method.

```js
onBeforeMount(async () => {
    ({ web5, did: myDID } = await Web5.connect({
        sync: '5s'
    }));
    console.log("this is your DID", myDID);

    // fetch shared list details.
    const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.read({
        message: {
            recordId: listId.value
        }
    })

    // fetch todos under list.
    const { records: todoRecords } = await web5.dwn.records.query({
        message: {
            filter: {
                parentId: listId.value
            },
        }
    })

    todoList = await record.data.json();

    // Add entry to ToDos array
    for (let record of todoRecords) {
        const data = await record.data.json();
        const todo = { record, data, id: record.id };
        todoItems.value.push(todo);
    }

    fetchingListInfo.value = false;
});
```

## Adding tasks to a todo list
To add a task, we want to connect it to the list as the parent, identify who authored it, store it with the schema matching the protocol and then also send it to the other party's DWN.

To get correct DID of which party to send the record to, since either of the author or recipient of the list could be the one creating the todo, we use a `getTodoRecipient()` to help us out.

```js
// pages/todos/[id].vue

let todoRecipient;

const getTodoRecipient = (list) => {
    if (list.author === myDID) {
        return list.recipient;
    }
    else {
        return list.author;
    }
}
```

Then in our `onBeforeMount() method`, we update the `todoRecipient` variable so that it's only updated when we've fetched the list details and gotten the participating DIDs.

```js
onBeforeMount(async () => {
...

    todoList = await record.data.json();
    todoRecipient = await getTodoRecipient();

...
});
```

### Creating the new Todo
We create a new todo by calling the `web5.dwn.records.create()` method. We pass the data we want to store, the protocol definition and the recipient DID.

```js
async function addTodo() {
    const todoData = {
        completed: false,
        description: newTodoDescription.value,
        author: myDID,
        parentId: listId.value
    };

    newTodoDescription.value = '';



    const { record: todoRecord, status: createStatus } = await web5.dwn.records.create({
        data: todoData,
        message: {
            protocol: protocolDefinition.protocol,
            protocolPath: 'list/todo',
            schema: protocolDefinition.types.todo.schema,
            dataFormat: protocolDefinition.types.todo.dataFormats[0],
            parentId: listId.value,
            contextId: listId.value,
        }
    });

    const data = await todoRecord.data.json();
    const todo = { todoRecord, data, id: todoRecord.id };
    todoItems.value.push(todo);

    const { status: sendStatus } = await todoRecord.send(todoRecipient);

    if (sendStatus.code !== 202) {
        console.log("Unable to send to target did:" + sendStatus);
        return;
    }
    else {
        console.log("Sent todo to recipient");
    }

}
```

## Toggling Todo status as completed
We want to be able to toggle the status of a todo as completed. We can do this by updating the `completed` property of the todo and sending it to the other party.

```js
async function toggleTodoComplete(todoItem) {
    let toggledTodo;
    let updatedTodoData;

    for (let todo of todoItems.value) {
        if (todoItem.id === todo.id) {
            toggledTodo = todo;
            todo.data.completed = !todo.data.completed;
            updatedTodoData = { ...toRaw(todo.data) };
            break;
        }
    }

    // Get record in DWN
    const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.read({
        message: {
            recordId: toggledTodo.id,
        }
    });

    // Update the record in DWN
    await record.update({ data: updatedTodoData });

    const { status: sendStatus } = await record.send(todoRecipient);

    if (sendStatus.code !== 202) {
        console.log("Unable to send updated data to target did:", sendStatus);
        return;
    }
    else {
        console.log("Sent todo update to recipient");
    }
}
```

Congratulations! We've just built a multi-paged, collaborative and decentralized web app that can be used by multiple users. You can check out the finished version of the app running on CodeSandbox.
