# Query from DWN

Before reading from your Decentralized Web Node (DWN), be sure to check out our [Quickstart guide](../../quickstart) to ensure you’ve properly imported the Web5 SDK. Additionally, make sure you’ve set up a DID before attempting to query from a DWN.

## Querying Protocols

The following snippet queries a DWN for protocols that match a given schema:

```js
const { protocols } = await web5.dwn.protocols.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      protocol: "https://music.org/protocol",
    },
  },
});
```

## Querying Records

The following snippet queries a DWN for records that were written by a specific DID, match a given schema, and are in a specific data format:

```js
const { records } = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  from: 'did:example:alice',
  message: {
    filter: {
      schema: 'https://schema.org/Playlist',
      dataFormat: 'application/json'
    }
  }
});
```

## Sorting Query Results

Query results can also be sorted via the dateSort field.

The valid values for dateSort are:
createdAscending - sorts results by dateCreated in ascending order
createdDescending - sorts results by dateCreated in descending order
publishedAscending - sorts results by datePublished in ascending order
publishedDescending - sorrts results by datePublished in descending order

### Ascending Order

This code snippet queries for records and returns them in ascending order by the date they were published.

```js
const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      dataFormat: 'text/plain',
    },
    //highlight-start
    dateSort: 'publishedAscending'
    //highlight-end
  }
});
```

### Descending Order

This code snippet queries for protocols and returns them in descending order by the date they were created.

```js
const { protocols } = await web5.dwn.protocols.query({
  message: {
    filter: {
      protocol: 'http://social-media.xyz',
    },
    //highlight-start
    dateSort: 'createdDescending'
    //highlight-end
  }
});
```
